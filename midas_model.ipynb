economy world stopped using dollar impact brics u many war middle east supposedly oil never really take oil u rich 800 military base around world defence budget larger rest world combined country still hold u dollar reserve u trillion dollar debt much debt u economy still afloat thought putting together anyone else may want learn gleaned reading matter economist anyone want correct anything would welcome accept criticism reference material substantiating point 1944 country entered bretton wood agreement basically said world ’ currrecies would backed u dollar u dollar would backed gold country could convert currency u dollar redeem u gold exchange rate 35 dollar per ounce gold since u largest gold reserve time 75 entire world s gold everyone agreed also allowed u treasury fix exchange rate dollar different currency set interest rate interbanking transaction etc however multiple war u ’ 60 caused domestic inflation u value dollar fall caused panic country started redeeming gold u treasury u gold fell 20000 tonne 8100 tonne quickly thus 1971 nixon closed gold window ie suspended ability nation redeem u gold dollar took gold backing u dollar allowed u retain gold reserve made need u dollar among country non existent everyone started move away dollar u economy started spiral price gold became 135 dollar per ounce top arab world hiked oil price u desperately needed stabilize spiral brokered deal saudi oil producer would trade oil nothing u dollar convince opec middle eastern north african oil producing country also invest opec ’ oil profit u treasury buying u treasury bond basically mean opec buying u debt u printing dollar amount foreign investment u treasury made oil producing nation oil profit basically profit every barrel sold opec make way u treasury become value dollar printed ultimately profit oil stronger dollar lesser profit oil weaker dollar thus u get double benefit every barrel oil way exchange u would sell saudi advance weapon gold demanded basically weapon gold sale exchange trading oil dollar prop u dollar gold still propping u dollar indirectly forcing oil producer trade dollar thus petrodollar born caused world need u dollar wanted buy oil needed u dollar either converting currency selling stuff u latter preferred cheaper exchanging currency also grows economy u became benchmark international trade since country hope grow economy without using energy aka oil ’ oil without u dollar long country need oil u print dollar thin air balance oil barrel explained without actually even owning single drop oil country need gold balance currency u need control oil need control currency traded keep economy afloat later u foreign policy similarly u bokered deal latin american country trade u dollar also give precedence u eu japanese product trade country decide shun dollar trade currency would eventually cause opec switch well dollar could collapse well u basically printing enormous amount money thin air money used domestically much larger extent globally international oil trade dollar stop people stop needing dollar use currency internationally circulating dollar would come back u many dollar little amount treasury would cause hyperinflation economic spiral however logical next step would destroy excess dollar coming abroad would keep country ’ economy afloat okay remember dollar printed foreign investment treasury profit oil trade dollar would go away well essentially leaving nothing treasury dollar valued hence dollar literally worth money printed second since u currency basically petrodollar power depends control oil right whoever control middle east major power today saudi arabia control middle east u control saudi arabia ussaudi brotherhood sort make impossible country influence russia tried decade establish strong foothold middle east unsuccessful also dictated u foreign policy far last 5 decade like said u need control oil reserve currency oil traded hence war hear oil actually oil per se intimidation tactic country announced would longer accept dollar currency international oil trade egs ayatollah iran announced intention denounce dollar oil trade use currency instead u backed iraq go war iran even provided weapon mass destruction use iran later used excuse invade iraq prosecuted saddam hussein iraq invaded kuwait major producer oil able pay loan kuwait later asked euro used oil trade rather petrodollar u invaded iraq gaddafi asked gold based dinar instead u dollar oil trade u invaded libya chavez u staged coup venezuela however starting nonpetro currency would break link oil middle east would become le relevant economic power interest energy concern still important le economic geopolitical chessboard u today may actually solution achieving peace middle east however another thing happens middle east control price oil tied dollar recently middle east opec basically saudi arabia decided drop international price economic reason country oil production major source revenue trade dollar eg many n african country venezuela seen economy completely stabilise destroyed country sick u saudi controlling market way affect country adversely hence country switching international trading system gold based currency cause economy stabilise international reserve eu etc hand seen increased holding opec country worried increasing power country international banking system would glad get rid holding non dollar currency would cause fall u dollar value lieu another thing need considered lot developing country international trade deficit trade deficit currency country debt owed internationally accepted currency eg dollar debt dollar conversion interest rate borrowing determined according rule u treasury rate u treasury linked value dollar country giving loan prefer dollar historically dollar strong trusted collapse hence money owe safe country taking loan also convert debt dollar easier country debt owed change value debt owed manipulating currency dollar determined conversion currency fixed rate safe everyone however slight problem owe debt 1 dollar someone pay debt depend value dollar currency particular instant dollar gotten stronger wrt currency shall pay money dollar gotten weaker owe le money currency hence fall dollar would beneficial country owe debt dollar bad country loaned debt dollar also taking debt dollar becomes cheaper value dollar fall since u treasury interest rate directly tied dollar hence becomes cheaper borrow dollar also said grows weaker still yo owe le money one thing consider regarding fall dollar uptil oil producer buying u treasury bond due bretton wood deal country u corporation u treasury give fixed rate interest investing treasury rate turn linked value dollar stronger dollar interest u treasury bond foreign country invest mean foreign country would much rather invest money u treasury assured fixed rate interest invest 3rd world country take risk maybe losing however value dollar fall country would much rather draw u treasury invest startup different country domestically etc side coin would country dependent u investment value dollar fall investment received u would lesser value hand one thinh like said investment dollar governed u treasury rule basically u bank cut tax money transfer conversion artificially keeping low fuel domestic world trade etc dollar collapse people ’ trade dollar would trade currency inetrbanking across world would governed rule currency trade eg brics nation follow tariff etc shanghai bank reserve held effect would depend rule bank deal detrimental beneficial depending bank ’ policy compared dollar also country holding u treasury would lose entire value foreign reserve hand coountries like brics reserve international bank would retain value foreign reserve bank mean indian currency would also fall fall dollar current state usually run around perception indian currency backed gold ’ true truth 99 today ’ currency u dollar euro indian rupee fiat currency ie value determined gold hold economic strength government average 4–7 country ’ currency today backed gold u dollar 45 indian rupee 5 rest held term foreign reserve country like form u dollar around 70 u treasury bond world bank imf currency around 25 brics foreign reserve etc currently r 1000 r 50 gold around 670 held form u dollar r 280 currency might ask well remember bretton wood agreement time u 75 world ’ gold backed dollar dollar backed currency currency country backed directly indirectly dollar gold difficult keep gold country convenient country hold foreign reserve dollar especially fixed exchange rate provided hence portion currency held dollar however nixon shock 1971 dollar removed gold backing automatically currency backed dollar 99 world currency also became fiat currency result however dollar still good trusted one thought much especially since dollar printed thin air however prospect trust dollar fading started worry expert senseless printing dollar exchange fiat currency total amount currency nowhere near compensated gold reserve even gold world put together would form 10 currency world putting disturbing detail aside dollar collapse 670 rupee 1000 would become worthless ’ wise hold u dollar many country woken fact china secretly amassing large amount gold opec country started removing capital u treasury see oil producer receiving u gold exchange trading oil u dollar accumulated holding country ’ treasury crazy gold received bought material asset like real estate etc even country simply sell u treasury bond buy asset gold real estate recent year start depleting treasury cause fall value dollar turn causing country withdraw invest elsewhere coupled russia china trade rouble yuan india iraq trading oil outside dollar germany china trading outside dollar strenghtening brics bank etc dollar showing steady decline india also wisen start replenishing treasury gold sell holding dollar euro invest currency rise one reason brics could important india country brics whether like another thing using another currency would would take away power u slap economic sanction whichever country choose one major reason putin teamed china order bypass u sanction edit thing worry nation international trade foreign reserve dollar give u single handed say economy like nixon s unilateral decision changed fate currency decision also change economy u dictate rule nt follow sanction country want take back power making decision hand next petrodollar based commodity depleted oil reserve declining world moving towards source gree energy nuclear energy etc petrodollar decline destined however would u next could shift backing currency nuclear reserve new crazy idea someone s hat inevitably affect country want say hand china s attempt start gold backed currency may pan like said gold world sufficient back currency world also since currency still large amount dollar backing fall dollar would make percent currency valueless therefore even reserve another foreign currency could still cause fall indian currency though might little mitigated hand fiat currency run investor
