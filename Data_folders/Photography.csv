Is my dream of being a photographer a meaningless one in India?,17,g2eicl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g2eicl/is_my_dream_of_being_a_photographer_a_meaningless/,16,1587071050,"I am a Btech student, going to pass his final year. Amidst the pandemic scenes, I lost my campus placement. I was not interested in it anyway as I hated the course I took with all my heart(Computer Science). I took it as I didn't have much knowledge about ny future after higher secondaries and everyone said taking computer science would land me a job.

I regret this decision more than anything in my life.

I find many thing interesting, like designing stuffs, may it be posters, cars or anything. My parents and friends always used to say I have an artistic mind. I draw a lot too, good pictures also.

Then I got into photography, I take a lot of photos and still do. Have won 2-3 local photography contests. But never invested in it because I never got time to do so.

Also I never knew how to get into this photography field? I don't know anything else than taking photos and posting them on social media for meaningless likes.

By photography I mean wildlife, landscape, etc. I wish to work for any established companies as their photographer. I really wont care about the salary very much as atleast I would love what I'm doing. The thought of sitting infront if a computer just drives me crazy everyday.

I need help and advice. Do I need to complete degrees in photography to get into the field? Please help me in anyway you can.

TL;DR: Good student, joined Btech, hates life, loves photography, need advice for photography career.",8

[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,9,dc6k28,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dc6k28/serious_how_would_people_in_india_react_if/,20,1570027532,"PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way. Thanks for reading.",8

Since my high school, photography is something that has always interested me and made my eyes sparkle in a unexplainable way. Everytime I scroll through Instagram, there is a cry inside me to try to make it as a photographer.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?",8

Visiting India,11,es78p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es78p7/visiting_india/,9,1579698430,"Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture.",8

Ping me if you are experienced and could discuss this with me. 

Hi! I am a 20 year old. I am very interested in Photography and I would like to engage more systematically in it. I am a beginner.
I would like to invest in a good DSLR camera as I don't own one yet. Someone who could guide me on that and also take me through things on beginning in this field. I would like to intern under someone as an assistant so I can get exposed to the on field working and learn practically.


I am passionate about capturing anything evoking an emotion. I believe myself to have an eye for detail and an active observer of everyday little things. I like to document them. 
As of now I have just tried my hand in Phone Photography and uploaded pictures on my Instagram. The photos I click are sometimes personal to what I relate to and often open to interpretation.

Thank you for reading! Please help me out.",8

I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2226,ciddbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,462,1564232122,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)


Thanks,


Failure at 25.

Watching movies in India is a truly unique experience.,131,dcqkjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcqkjk/watching_movies_in_india_is_a_truly_unique/,54,1570136480,"Seriously, there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen. I went to watch Joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened.

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

Thoughts about the movie? It's great. Just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd. Dunno why these people worship The Joker.",8

What are photography laws in India for public places?,38,3toad9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3toad9/what_are_photography_laws_in_india_for_public/,27,1448124820,"I just got into an argument with my friends who were under the impression that it is illegal to take photographs of a person without their permission even in a public place. I was dazed by their belief and their view of morality regarding that. Shortly after they withdrew from the conversation, refusing to talk further and leaving me frustrated.

 I could find only a little information concerning the matter on internet. And I have a lot of questions now. There doesn't seem to be any unified concrete law for photography. If there is one please let me know. 

An important article I found [here](http://blog.sujitshetty.com/2009/04/photographers-rights-in-india.html) has this information
>Passengers are now also permitted to take photographs from inside an aircraft while in flight or landing/take off at civil aerodromes. 

Which reminds me of the [arrest of 3 for taking picture of air hostesses](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-mahasabha-functionary-among-3-arrested-for-taking-pictures-of-air-hostesses-in-indigo-flight/)

Now I am not saying whether it was morally justified to take her photos when she clearly objected, but I am questioning whether it is illegal. So if I go to a public park and take a photo of a woman, does she have the power to put me into jail if I don't delete the photos on her request?

In the aforementioned case, the persons were charged under *IPC Section 354*(assault or criminal force to **woman** with intent to outrage her modesty) and under the *Sexual Harassment of* ***Women*** *at Workplace* (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. 

This brings me to another question, is taking pictures of a woman without consent an act of sexual harassment? And what would have been the charges if the flight attendant was a man instead of a woman?

[Career Advice] Exploring opportunity in IT sector.,11,d0jtpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0jtpf/career_advice_exploring_opportunity_in_it_sector/,8,1567820098,"Hi fellow Indians. 

I would like your advice on prospective career development in IT sector. Though I am already working in field of art - photography, graphic designing, video editing etc. I am now looking for something new in IT as it has always been something that I am being recommended since past 20 years so thought why not give it a go. Those who are already in this field, please let me know what are my options. 

Let me first tell you about myself so that you may know where I stand right now and where should I begin. 

• I love learning about new technology, how it works, whats going on in background etc. I do easily figure out behind the scenes of a hardware or software by using it for a while or maybe after a bit of research. That’s why I am good at troubleshooting because I can easily identify the fault and works towards it and don’t even hesitate to go into rabbit hole if the problem demands it. 

• I also am a bit of tinkerer and like to develop my own things like using raspberry pi to make ot into my door opener, use it as DNS blocker (/r/pihole), make it into my own Alexa device, hosting my own websites and hardening the security of it etc. And now a days I am tinkering with NodeMCU to use it for home automation using the HomeKit by Apple. 

• Speaking of Apple, I love breaking the boundaries set by it in their iOS and do more than an average user (/r/Jailbreak). Because of things I mentioned in first point, I am also good at troubleshooting unique problems that only I am facing due to the combinations of tweaks I made in the system.

• Although I can understand most of the code and figure out the problem/BTS, modify it a bit according to my preference but I can not code the whole thing myself. 

Please let me know if this is enough to begin with or should I learn more before even thinking about any course or training. Also based on my information, what are my options and where should I start. 

If you are still reading, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking out time.",8

I was reading a thread a few days ago where I read about a fellow redditor posting from a village, where he runs a business. It was interesting to learn that /r/india's users aren't just city dwellers. 

So I thought, why not start a thread where each week we post pictures based on a particular theme. /u/PiedPiperOfKremlin and I discussed a bit and decided to keep it as candid as possible.

I don't want to keep any strict rules or anything, but please avoid filters, photoshop effects or any touch ups. This isn't a photography contest but just a way for us to visually share our surroundings.

I'll keep today's theme simple. 

""The view from your window or balcony at home""

Hopefully this kicks off and turns into a regular weekly thread.

Why do people spend years preparing for civil service exams?,74,bh942l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bh942l/why_do_people_spend_years_preparing_for_civil/,75,1556230386,"A few months back I visited my friend who was preparing for civil service exams. The guy was preparing for the fourth consecutive year and I feel even this year he couldn't clear it so probably he would prepare again. It has been four years since we graduated from college and it is extremely difficult for me to understand how people can trade the prime years of there life for just preparing for an exam.

There is one thing called passion. I understand someone who is very passionate about say Programming, Photography, Acting etc and spends years trying to build a product, improve his photography or get a good acting role respectively. It is because these people probably are doing what they like and there is no better way of spending your 20s in my opinion. 

But preparing for civil services for such a long amount of time seems like a complete waste of time to me. People don't know what it is like to be an IAS/IPS/IES etc. They are spending so many years in their youth cramming for an exam without even knowing what it is like to be one of those things. And during this time most people have absolutely no life. I asked my friend about his daily routine and what he does on weekends etc and I was surprised how he could spend these years like that which were devoid of much human interaction, adventure, traveling, making money or doing anything that you would have good memories about down the line.

By the way, I am not questioning civil services or people preparing for that. There is nothing wrong with that. I am just asking why people continue doing it for so long when they fail the first one or two times when they don't even know if they'd like the actual job or not. I feel it is an utter waste of time even if you become an IAS after say your sixth attempt by which time you'd have spent six most prime years of your life doing absolutely nothing.",8

[SERIOUS] I am stuck with my career and could use some guidance on what to do next. I am genuinely lost.,19,cm92t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm92t0/serious_i_am_stuck_with_my_career_and_could_use/,8,1565028279,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

&#x200B;

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

&#x200B;

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

&#x200B;

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

&#x200B;

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.  


Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

&#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",8

I study in a well reputed college and have been scoring good marks ( 84% as of now, 8.4 CGPA) throughout my course although my scores seems to be dropping semester after semester.

I went for engineering coaching and got really interested to take it mainly because I wasn't exposed to any other streams other than engineering and medicine. So I took Computer Science as my degree because I had a faint interest in it and it had a lot of job opportunities. 

But since my second year I started hating computer science, every aspect of it. I know many like it but it's just a no-go for me. I tried many fields like Block chain, Web Designing (had a little interest, the coding part ruined it), Machine learning, IoT, etc. but nothing sparks any interest in me. Now, just hearing the fact that I have to do the project and seminar for next year just brings me pain.

Now I have no idea what to do. There are campus placements in my college the coming year and I don't think I can pass them in the case of interviews or logical questioning as I am really bad at coding and most theory parts. And even if I pass, I don't think I will be interested in the work too.

I have a lot of interest in studying architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me(which Computer science doesn't). I am interested a lot in Photography (I take good photos too) and Graphic Design as well. But the career scope in these are very small compared to computer science. Also I have no idea how to develop these skills to a career/professional level one without committing to them, which in turn waste my time on studies and computer science.

What should I do?  Do I continue with computer science till I get an interest in it (which I don't think I will) or should I change my whole career to something else that I am interested in??

EDIT: I know changing careers would be a huge task and risk for me so I am trying my best to find a suitable field for me in computer science itself. Changing careers is like my last resort and I wouldn't do it unless I really want to.

1. UPSC CSE( IRS , specifically because it is all in all a desk job in my estimation, also is a great backup if I attemp the CSE again the subsequent year)

3. SSC CGL( I have heard ministry of external affairs department has a few desk jobs. Also, ASO)

However, you can take your hipsterishness to new levels and start shooting real film and develop it yourself. The equipment is cheap, film is not. There's plenty of places you can get the film developed/scanned, and if you plan to develop it yourself, you can still get chemicals (although the choice is getting more and more limited). 

Black and White photography is more fun. The results are different from your average digi shots (even with your digicam's Black and White setting) and it's easy to develop at home. And the photos look great.. More dramatic. 

Color film (Negatives) will still get you better shots than your point and shoot, but since you're not instant feedback you never know if you got the shot or not (This holds a certain appeal to people - The waiting part). 

Then you have Color Slide Film which is tougher to shoot than film (harder to get exposure right), but the colors and sharpness is insane and you get to see the photos right there on the strip (Negatives are, well, negatives).

Reddit India Recap of 2018,213,ab62uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ab62uu/reddit_india_recap_of_2018/,27,1546281792,"Welcome to the first ever installment of a year in review of this subreddit where we look at some of the best and most influential events and posts of this year. 

2018 has been quite a rollercoaster of a year for this subreddit as well as the country! With one of the highest growth rates ever of this subreddit. We grew from just above 100K subscribers to now more than the 1.6L magic number of subscribers. 

The year saw landmarks Supreme Court judgements in India, most importantly the striking of Section 377 of the IPC criminalizing gay sex. We have had many amazing posts this year which go from the entire subreddit grouping together to help people in Kerala with the largest donation drive ever on this subreddit with verified donations over ₹7,00,000 to paying college fees of a user who couldn't afford to. 

Here are some highlights in **no particular order** which made up this year of r/india: 

* [The massive Kerala donation drive started](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/981o7s/will_donate_thrice_the_number_of_upvotes_amount/) by /u/TheBeginnerr to match the donations to the upvotes of the thread inspired hundreds of Redditors to donate to the Kerala Disaster Relief Fund.  

* [Hindustan pencils responding to a request by a mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7k0muz/a_mother_wrote_to_hindustan_pencils_about_her/) sends special sharpeners created to be used by left-handed people with ease.

* [India and Pakistan bond over ](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8f0jig/pakistani_friend_of_mine_tried_a_lays_indias/) the flavour of Lay's India Magic Masala

* [Section 377 gets scrapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dfine/gay_sex_has_been_decriminalised_in_india_the/) and gay sex gets decriminalized after one of the longest legal battles in Indian history and \#LoveWins.  
And the [beautiful image of a son no longer being considered a criminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dt64s/if_you_are_not_moved_by_this_picture_i_wish_i_had/) became one of the highest voted posts of this year. 

* Among the many historical posts, r/india particularly loved the pictures of [three women training to be doctors (1885)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7mczx1/an_indian_woman_a_japanese_woman_and_a_syrian/),  [historical photos of Bhagat Singh posted on the day of his death anniversary](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86h70i/87_years_ago_today_shaheed_bhagat_singh_was/),  a [smog-free New Delhi from the 1950s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9wow0r/new_delhi_in_1950s_clean_air_without_smog/), [a French boy introducing himself to Indian soldiers during the First World War](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7x16j8/a_french_boy_introduces_himself_to_indian/) and [Prof. C.V Raman teaching in 1960s](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9d7nxf/1960s_physicist_cvraman_teaching_in_class/).

Please note there have been hundreds of amazing posts I haven't been able to list partially due to practicality, and partially due to character limits. But, just because it isn't here doesn't mean your post was not amazing. :P

* Photography does not have to be limited to scenery. [This image of a police officer saving a girl from burning to death](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7nfwz3/np_constable_sudarshan_shinde_saving_a_girl/) surely counts as an amazing photo.

* And a photo of kids at the [back of a school bus](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ztvst/i_took_a_picture_of_a_school_bus_from_behind/) is always adorable, isn't it?

* A slightly [morbid imprint left on the Delhi Metro after years of use](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ttt1x/this_mildly_interesting_imprint_left_behind_after/).

* [While this stunning photo not only became popular here, but rather all over other social medias](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8uzewx/this_is_india/)

Can I become a Commercial Pilot?,13,crx8tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crx8tg/can_i_become_a_commercial_pilot/,1,1566134203,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone here is doing great today! :)  


This year I made a resolution that I will learn something new any chance I get. I got a camera and started learning photography and still learning and one thing that interested me from a very long time is Flying/driving/riding. I always love to drive/ride. Now I am thinking to learn how to fly but I thought it was impossible because you need physics and math ( I am a commerce Student) as an entry requirement. Recently I was looking for flying club for hobby flying and I cam across Bombay Flying Club. They have multiple courses. 

  
 STUDENTS PILOT’S LICENCE (SPL)

 PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL)

 COMMERCIAL PILOT LICENCE (CPL)  
 [https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot\_training.html](https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot_training.html) 

  
For the 1st two there is no Physics or Math requirement for learning how to fly but for Commercial Lience you need   Physics and Math’s.   


So what I was wondering If I complete  PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL) or they also havbe Single Engine Flying Training will I be able for Commercial Pilot Licence like will I be able to join airline industry as pilot.   


Any suggestions/advice will be much appreciated.

does it ever happen to you? I get obsessed about new hobbies for a while and then I stop them,5,bykzgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bykzgg/does_it_ever_happen_to_you_i_get_obsessed_about/,5,1560120784,"I am noticing a pattern with myself. I feel like I want to try new things, initially I spend lot of time researching, how to start, what all things to buy etc.. once I buy those things, it slowly fades away. I don't even feel like I am interested in those. 

I have wasted a lot of time. But moreover I feel bad about my behaviour. Here are some things I tried in the last year and how I wasted money

1. Bought an expensive guitar. Thought I will learn guitar, so bought Yamaha F310. I spent a month researching which guitar to buy, which sites to follow to learn guitar etc. I didn;t even practise for a week. Now it is gathering dust.

2. Photography. Everyone suggested don't buy an expensive camera. But I thought, photography is the one. Bought an expensive Nikon 7 series DSLR. Played around it for a month. But thats it. Now, I dont even feel like taking photos. 

3. Books. I don't read books at all. So I thought I will start reading and develop this hobby. This interest also peaked when there was a thread on randia in book suggestions. I bought most of the books which were suggested in that thread (close to 20 I think). Till today I haven't moved past first chapter of a book.

4. Drones. They were all craze last year. Bought DJI Spark and never really used it. Sold it off OLX after 6 months, bearing heavy losses. 

5. Online Mooc courses. Signed up, but never completed. Good thing coursera charges monthly basis and you can cancel anytime you want to.

6. Drawing / Doodling. Thought I will try this as a hobby. Bought so many learning material, books, sheets, pencils etc etc. In this list, this prolly is the least expensive one.

7. I guess you get the gist now. So I will just mention things: carpentry, cooking, play station 4 (though sold it off quickly with minimal loss), bicycle, skateboard, gym membership, home gym equipments, arduino electronic kits, trekking materials 

all of these have a same pattern:

1. first I find about or learn about something new on reddit or from some people trying it out. It could be entirely a new thing which I never heard of OR some thing which I never tried earlier.

2. Next I spend insane amount of time researching it. Sometimes this goes over months. (e.g. for camera, drone etc). I try to read online about each and every thing. Product related or user experiences. Sometimes I have even made notes on these things

3. I spend money, get the things which are required. 

4. I try out for couple of days to couple of weeks. Then I completely stop. 

5. Post this period, I don't even feel like thinking about or learning.

5. I feel so guilty of this, I avoid encountering those things. For example, most of the stuff is hidden or kept away in cupboard so that I don't look at them everyday. I avoid whatsapp / telegram related groups, like photography groups etc completely. 

6. Then I find something new to obsess about and the whole thing repeats. 

Does this happen with any of you here?",8
I'm stuck with my career and could use some guidance. I am genuinely lost.,7,cm8zqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm8zqf/im_stuck_with_my_career_and_could_use_some/,1,1565027658,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount for some donkey job where I don't have to think much, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.

Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",8

Need of advice from married people on choosing a life partner,12,ad5bax,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ad5bax/need_of_advice_from_married_people_on_choosing_a/,22,1546807714,"_TL;DR_ Would you settle and make best out of what you have got or would you take risk and try harder? Not that I will blindly follow one's advice but it will help me to take good decision.

I'm from middle class who is an introvert, well groomed, fit and active. Having varied interests and hobbies keeps me occupied esp., travelling, trekking and photography. Working in a small IT startup I earn enough to live a comfortable life.

My parents have been trying to get me married for the past 3 years. Coming from a small city, my family is moderately conservative. They definitely want a bride in same caste and matching horroscope. Most preferably in same city so that they can know well about bride's family background. We are signed up in matrimonial sites also. The selection process is usually this: my parents check for kundli match and girl's family, out of which I choose one that's looking good, then if both families agree do we have a meeting in a temple. That's when I look for matching personality.

Parents are dissatisfied and already tired of me as I'm picky. They expect me to choose the one just with good family and kundli match. They don't care about personality and the appearance. Met couple of potential bride vis a vis with family in a temple who were good looking but are boring ""family girls"" who doesn't have passion for anything nor did they show interest in what I do. So we didn't proceed.

Recently I met similar one. We talked for 15 mins. It was me talking most of the time. She asked about my job, do I own car, can I cook. I try to understand her from her daily activities. She was like home-to-work, work-to-home in weekdays and may visit malls in the weekends if not visiting hometown. There wasn't much of similarities other than both of us are in software industry. Her realtive was rushing to end this talk and she didn't have anything to talk. Their family and girl instantly showed their interest to proceed. I held my parents, who were also interested, and said we'll go home and reply.

It was difficult for me to decide life partner within few minutes. I want to know many other things including whether she can keep herself healthy and fit in the future, whether she is interested to accompany me for weekend trips, etc. Made my parents to call them and ask for a casual meeting in a public place. They refused and will allow further talks only if I say yes. Pretty conservative and probably they fear I might reject after the talk and it'll be a shame for them.

I'm gonna hit 30 soon. It's considered past marriageable age by many. So, fewer opportunities. Also skewed sex ratio! I'm confused shall I settle for this (like [Bojack says](https://youtu.be/cTAi_3HWKHQ) ) or take risk and look out further. I appreciate your advice.

_EDIT:_ To provide better context, I don't have much of social circle. There are few male friends with whom I hangout occasionally and travel. They also don't have girlfriends. Actually they don't care about it. My introversion wasn't helpful to find a life partner.
I have had couple of relationships in the past whom I met through dating apps. They lasted few months to a year. If it were strong, I would be determined to marry irrespective of parents' approval. But no. Time is ticking more loudly now.",8

Broke up 30! What next???,12,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,1548813778,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

Since all these PMs had similar questions and I'm sure many others have similar questions but didn't PM, I'm consolidating them in here. So my thoughts on how candidates should go about getting hired

**My college sucks. I’ll be graduating in a year or two. What to do? What should I learn? What project should I do?**

Firstly, I'll just give a brief rundown of where I see the IT industry heading over the next 5-10 years. I think the 3 safest areas to build your career around are Android, iOS and Javascript. 

I do not see any other mobile OS breaking the dominance of Android or iOS in the next 10 years - the mobile OS wars are over and we are heading into the territory where Windows and OS X are now for the desktop. So learning Java/Android and Swift/iOS are safe bets. I do not see cross platform toolkits (Ionic, Xamarin etc) expanding beyond a niche so you don't need to worry about them. 

For web based apps, Javascript will always be evergreen since it is impossible for browsers to change the HTML/CSS/JS paradigm. And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually. However it isn't clear who'll win the client side framework wars (React? Vue? Angular? Some new framework?) so this is a tricky part. However, client side frameworks are fairly simple and learning one should provide a roadmap to learning all others.

My recommendation - pick either Javascript (Node.js + one of React/Vue/Angular) or Android/Java or iOS/Swift. Keep in mind though that Android/Java and iOS/Swift are more likely to be popular in consumer apps while Javascript (web apps) are more likely to be popular in business apps. Business apps generally quietly make lots and lots and lots of money but consumer apps are more fun to work on. Choose wisely. 

Now you've picked one - what project to do? Pick a hobby you have - music? photography? fitness?. *Make something that you will use everyday in this hobby*. For example, if fitness is your hobby then you can make a fitness goal tracking app. Divide the project into different levels of progression. Level one can be a simple way to log your workouts. Level two can be adding user profiles so you can see your friends workouts. Level three can be adding GPS tracking. Level four can be adding tracking diet. And so on. By the time you go for an interview, this project with all its different modules will be like your baby and you'll be able to spend hours talking about it.

Its important to pick a project where the app you'll build is something you will use. You'll never use a library management system or restaurant order management system so there is no point building these types of apps even though they most commonly show up when you search for ""app ideas"".

**<Insert Story of Company Recruitment Being Terrible/Time in Company Being Terrible>. Can you recommend me good companies?**

This is tricky. Sometimes, especially in big companies, they can be both great and terrible at the same time - because its your manager who usually sets the experience in the company. I can't really recommend but I can give some steps for finding ones. Firstly do not subscribe to cliches like that MNCs = evil, crappy work and startups = force of good, exciting work or Indian companies = all suck, crappy and US companies = amazing, high quality work. They are plenty of well run, great MNCs and plenty of terrible startups and well run Indian companies and crappy US companies . 

Here you'll have to put aside your programming skills and work on your social engineering skills. First, try and identify who'll be your manager. Ask your interviewers who'll be your manager after you are selected. Try and read up on him, web, his blogs, Linkedin etc. Try and see if can use your web stalking skills to find some ex-employees of him. Take them out for coffee or beer and try and get a sense of how they feel like their manager it. It might sound like too much work but its better than spending a year in hell counting down the days to when you can get your job and and move on from your nightmare of a manager.

**Certifications? Yay or nay?**

**NAY NAY NAY A HUNDRED TIMES NAY**. I can't believe we are still asking this question. I have yet to see a certification that actually was helpful. The only companies that seem to care about certifications are the ones that issue them themselves e.g. Cisco. 

**Time gap, failed papers, no degree, marks too low or something else negative. What to do?**

There is little you can do about it. A company will ever have a policy on it (e.g. not hire people without graduate degrees or with supplies) and there is nothing you can do about it OR they will not have a policy on it in which they will almost always hire you if you are good enough since there is a shortage of good CS engineers and all companies are desperate. Just make up some story to explain all these - family could not afford, medical reasons, family emergency etc a bit of white lies is better in this case than brutal honesty (I decided to just play video games all semester).

**Can I work with you?**

I should have written the rant 3 years ago when I was still recruiting :). Unfortunately, about 2 years ago I decided to just keep my business on autopilot mode. This meant transiting out of full time employees to short term contractors. I little over 30 now - have sufficient savings from both working in USA and from my business and will eventually sell my business in 1-2 years so I have no financial urgency to work for the next couple of years. So, I am just taking it easy mostly these days, trying to think of what new adventures await and shitposting on Randia =). ",8

I've not studied much my entire life, as I was able to manage upto 10th without having to study. 11th was a huge kick in the ass for me - but I've learnt nothing and have still not started studying. 


I've been thoroughly incapacitated by depression- which I've had for about five years now- and cannot hold a routine for shit. I'm taking therapy and medication, but depression isn't the only issue apparently, anxiety is a huge problem too. While the suicidal thoughts did recede for a while, they're coming back now, because of how big and final the board exams feel. I know I am going to fuck it up. I probably won't fail it, but anything below 90% is insignificant for OC anyway (I think).

So many people are helping me, yet I've done nothing but disappoint. Doesn't help that my family is filled with over-achievers. I am emotionally drained and exhausted. If I have to redo this year, I'd rather drop out or kill myself. What do I do now? What does a guy who fucks up his education do? I do shitty photography, and play shitty guitar. I am not good enough at either of them for it to be of any significance. I don't know if I will ever be able to push myself to actually study, because that's something I've been fooling myself with for the last year.


I have a practice practical exam tomorrow, and have not started shit for it. Fucked up every other revision exam. Every exam this year has been a disaster.

Its becoming hard/Impossible to find good CS jobs in India.,105,6v9vtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6v9vtx/its_becoming_hardimpossible_to_find_good_cs_jobs/,42,1503423230,"But unlike some people, I am willing to dedicate more of my resources and skills to find the right fit.

Why can't employers do the same?

Edit: Some questions I read.

Z921 in their rant on another thread here:
> You need to have a hobby other than photography

Who are you to decide what hobby is worth my time? Sounds like you are the kind of person to micro-manage your employees and be on people's shoulders like vedhal is to vikramadithya. Also sounds like you are/will be the kind of parent who does not like what their child is doing and would like him/her to study engineering.

> DumbwitPatra:
> What is your expectation from an employer? How can I, as an employer, assess you and be sure you're unlike the others? Jobs ARE available. But the people aren't knowledgeable enough. Even engineering passouts with 80-85% can't crack simple dynamic programming questions. I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people. If you're one among them, you'll get a job. If you aren't, you need to have visible proof that you have put in efforts to specialize in a particular field. The guy who is leading the AI team in my company is from BBA background. He learnt AI and math from the internet, built some applications and had content that would show his efforts. If you do have something like that, take your idea to a hackathon. You'll have your idea recognized even if you don't win and will get a job. However, I'm not sure if i understood your question right. What are you expecting from your employer and what change do you want to see in the way hiring is done?

Quantitative Aptitude exams. The messages you are sending to your prospective employees are:

* You only care about speed and memorizing power and nothing else about the developer because all your talk of github profiles and other hobbies does not come into play until you see my resume yourself which is usually after all the written rounds.
* For all the talk of being the risk takers in the industry, you don't want to trust your prospective employee so you pass up on a potentially good employee who may not have the best aptitude test taking skills.

What you expect to happen:

* You assume good aptitude problem skills imply good problem solving skills.
* You assume people won't game the aptitude round and learn just enough to pass that round.
* You assume that all the brilliant programmers solve the problems in no time and you are left with a roster of excellent developers.

What usually happens:

* People game the system and just study how to solve the test problems.
* Actually good developers may not have the time to study aptitude problems because, surprise! they are busy learning actual programming. Many good developers get filtered out in the first round due to the lack of knowledge in aptitude.

> I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people.

15 or 20 students per college seems like the right amount of students who are actually passionate about their field. When the stakes are high, Skills go down a few notches. It's the observer effect. As soon as people find out they are being assessed or being watched they don't perform as well.

> What are you expecting from your employer?

* If you want Tom Cruise as your boyfriend, you need to be Cameron Diaz. If you want brilliant developers, you must be a innovating company who offers their weight in salary and/or Resume Value. If I am a good developer, then it is possible I know my worth. I am not going to put up with you for $400 a month or less.

* Stop taking credit for my work. I once heard that my friend got a pat in the back for making the company $12000. He never got a bonus or saw $1 of that money.

* I want you to stop whining and start treating employees like human beings. Pay them a proper wage and give them interesting problems to solve. Automate the boring stuff. Don't ask me to do the documentation manually. Haven't you heard of tools that do the documentation from comments in code?

* Once I am hired. I want a manager who actually understands what I am saying and not some prison warden who intimidates devs to get things done before a very early deadline that they came up with without consulting the devs. This is a sure way to make devs secretly hate you while burning out.

* I want reasonable work-life balance. I am passionate about programming, but I am a human being too.

* More investment into employee training or undergraduate education in the government. I know IT companies lobby a lot, so I expect them to actually put effort to improve the syllabus of colleges to suit what they want in terms of technical knowledge by diverting some money towards education.

I like CS actually.

Yes but I am not the one whining about not finding good developers. It is the employers looking for good developers but are not willing to pay them a living wage.

> People working as game testers for ₹10000 per month

There is your problem. Why are you not willing to pay more?

I am not personally looking for a job. I have one. It is good but I notice the bad side of IT occasionally. Namely the ""this will do"" attitude from people who expect a lot for less. It's about managing your expectations as an employer when you are asking your employees to manager their expectations of their salary.

I need some help in deciding what to do with my life. Any help would be appreciated.,36,7fxfgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7fxfgw/i_need_some_help_in_deciding_what_to_do_with_my/,22,1511837525,"Sorry for this huge wall of text, but I have to be detailed in this because I need some help.

I'm in a very weird situation in life right now and could use some advice. Please be honest. I'll give you a little background about myself without trying to dox me. I am a 25-year-old graphic designer by profession. I graduated from an average college in 2013 with a degree in Journalism (one of the biggest mistakes of my life, especially in terms of the three years I lost). After graduating from college, I was in a tough financial situation, so I had to immediately get a job to support myself. Since I knew the basics of photoshop, I just applied for a job as a graphic designer with an agency and got it. I worked there for 8 months, and quit due to deteriorating mental health. After that, I spent about a year and a half battling that mental condition, which still affects me, and again, got a job as a graphic designer at a startup, due to financial strain. I worked at that job for 6 months (till the company closed down) and then got my current job, which I have been working at for around 1.5 years, again, because I have no other skills. Now, in this 1.5 years + 6 months, is where I properly learned the tools of design and got some idea of how the industry works on the design front. Again, I never had any ambition in this field, I just got into because I had no other skills.

Another thing about my ""career""; Since I said, I took this job out of desperation, I'll be honest with you about my skills. Design doesn't come naturally to me. I have zero thought process on how to design. I have to look at tons of other things (like brochures, ads etc.) to even begin conceptualizing a layout or color scheme. I have come across some seriously talented and dedicated designers and sometimes feels ashamed of myself on how I work. Also, I am not terrible at what I do. I am pretty decent. Especially when I put my heart to it. But over the last few months, my mental issues, lack of confidence and general bleak outlook on life has made my job harder.

Now, I feel, that this job has reached a plateau phase and I have to do something better with my life. I was wondering if I should enroll in National Institute of Design's Graphic Design Post Graduate program. I don't know if it will actually help me learn or improve my life and job prospects in any way, but so far, whatever I do, I learned on the job.

Now some other details. Right now, I get paid 30K a month out of which, if I live an absolutely frugal lifestyle (no eating out in fancy places, no beer, no trips, no shopping), I save around 5K minimum around 10K maximum. I am talking about in terms of savings. If I do plan to enroll, I will only be able to in the 2019-2021 Batch. I feel I will need a year to start properly saving up, get loans, writing all the entrance exams and preparing myself.

Now here are my other concerns. When I look at this roadmap, I will be ""job ready"" only by the age of 29. Which is a very scary thought for me, because I will be sorta back to square one. Another major issue for me is, even though my life is quite bleak, one of the few things in life that keep me going is the woman I love. She is not the kind who will ever pressurize me into marriage (even though her parents will) and she told me, if I am serious about this, she will convince them to wait for me to finish graduating.

I want to know, is this sudden jump worth the risk? Honestly speaking, I feel very depressed and quite often suicidal because of the mediocre life I have led so far, and nothing seems like a happy ending to me. Even thinking of this move, has taken a huge toll on my already deteriorating mental health. I am talking about if this will help me long term in terms of career opportunities. I don't aim to slack off and ""party"" through college if I get in. I am willing to slog to the point of death if this will actually help me.

What would really help me, other than general advice is, if anyone has studied in NID, they could tell me if the course is worth my time and money. Will I actually learn something there? Like I said, I am ready to work my ass off because I know I only have one shot at this and I don't want to botch that. Also, if you do know anyone who studied there, could you please link them to this post, or just ask them?

**Edit:** Hey guys. Sorry, I just saw the post now. Wasn't feeling to well and just wen't to bed after posting. First of all, thanks for taking your time and talking to me. I am sorry that I didn't state much of my technical knowledge and the source of motivation for me to even look up NID.

**Source of motivation:** So, like I mentioned above, I got into design because I HAD to get a job, and the only bankable skill I had was how to use photoshop. Everything else, I learnt on the job, mostly through trial and error. I started feeling a course in design would help me because it will give me a more structured approach into working.  A better understanding of layouts, colors, what works, what doesn't. Honestly, one of the biggest drawbacks I have is, convincing the client of the final design. Like, even when I present it to them, I do it with this weird look showing a huge lack in confidence, and that usually lets them ask me for multiple changes or with them saying they are not happy with the design. The current job I am working at, my boss is my friend from college, and he encourages me a lot to work without thinking of these things, but in the end, when I interact with the clients, this still happens. They say, yeah, the design is okay. Could we have another iteration? My friend is the one who convinces them into accepting the design saying a lot of business jargon. Bottom line is, I always see my work as mediocre and cannot accept it as what it is. I know, a Degree from NID won't immediately have an impact in my thought process, but I fell, I can at least support my self by saying, I do have an idea of what I want to do.

Another question I came across a few times with the answers you people wrote were whether I am looking to study for a bump up in the salary? My answer is primarily no. Yes, overtime I would love a nice paying job, but right now, it's more of me to learn something, because everything I do right now is from looking at other peoples works. I don't know how correct I am when I say this, but I feel that a degree from NID will add that prestigious college stamp, and help me get better opportunities and a better network too. And and some weight to me, mentally, in terms of confidence.

Technical Knowledge and hobbies - Adobe Illustrator (most proficient in this), Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Hobbies - Photography (very amateur). I can write a bit of content too. But it's not something I would market.

Another weird point (I don't know if it's relevant) is, I am quite well versed in pop culture and ""western culture"" of sorts. The reason I am bringing this up is, I use this as a major influence when I work in terms of design. Many menus and interior decor designs I did for my clients (which they loved), were inspired from this and they said it looks and feels much different from boring things they usually see elsewhere. I mean, it's not a huge skill. Lot of people nowadays are more ""globalized"" and dazzle people with one liners from TV shows and all in their designs, but I just mentioned this, because the agency I work for got a lot of praise from these ""out-of-box-for-india"" style work.",8

[R] Why are Indians blindly running after MONEY???,24,5zqaur,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5zqaur/r_why_are_indians_blindly_running_after_money/,99,1489696433,"What i dont understand is that why do Indians run for Money!!!. Wherever i look, everyday, i see Indians trying to get squeeze every inch of a penny from customers, trying to sell everything possible. etc. 

The people working for salaries like 50k or even 90k or 1.5L a month, don't actually have a life. to be honest ( MY opinion)

Okay, a person earning 1.5 L a month (like a cousin in delhi does) is extremely busy all the time. I have seen high earning salaried class, going to offices from 7 AM (2 hour drive) , returning at 10pm. Sometimes, they are thrown away to projects in other cities for months at a time. 

And in some places, Saturdays are also working. and on top of that, fierce competition, stress, anxiety. 

I know a person earning 3L a month. He has to go to office at 8am, and he returns at 11pm. He works in exports (Merchandiser). The stress he is in everyday in unbelievable. He suffers from insomnia and panic attacks. Is this MONEY worth your health???

People are dying In exchange for What? MONEY? shit doesnt get more stupid then this. 

Before people start burning me and asking me how i live my life. I basically started from scratch with clear goals in Mind when i made my own company at age of 21
1) Work only 4 hours a day
2) Holidays - 2 atleast in a year
3) No Stress related work
4) Debtfree forever
5) Self-Sustaining income
6) Passive income from investments

Today, even if i dont work, i can live through my life from passive income. Hell, i can live even without passive income. 

And a lot of Indians can live like the way i live. But they choose not to , for one simple reason. MORE MONEY. 

A lot of people i know personally. like 95% of them, live under loans. Car loans, house loans, credit card lines, PC limits, etc. They are basically stuck in a vicious circle of being a spend thrift and then working their asses off to pay the monthly obligations and creating more obligations for themselves for a FAKE future. 

Although when you transfer yourself into a more frugal and acceptable way of living, you will realise that the true happiness if being with your family, spending time with kids, chilling out in the sun and not thinking you will be late for office. And most importantly, being DEBT-FREE. Only after that you can think of creating Self-Sustaining earning for yourselves. 

Just ask yourself few questions and maybe they don't all apply to you, and maybe a few of them do. But if they do, just think why are you doing this? and creating Stress for yourself.
1. Why do you need a phone that costs 40k+?
2. Why do you need to buy a house on loan?
3. Why buy a car on loan? 
4. Why spend what you dont have yet (C.C.)
5. Why work more than 45 Hours a week? 
6. Why you go on a holiday and post pictures on facebook EVERYTIME? (Occasionally its okay)
7. Why do you put pictures of the food you eat on Insta, FB, Twitter??? 
8. Does it feel like, you are travelling to various places just to put pictures on your facebook and insta??? and if it does, why do you do it?
9. Dont you feel that your Job is hindering in doing what you actually LIKE? (Travelling, Hiking, Trekking, Exploring) etc.
10. Even if you can afford the most expensive phones? why do you ACTUALLY need it? have you asked yourself that? 
11. Have you lost touch with various people you loved? and WHY have you? Lack of TIME?
12. Do you want to learn something technical and CANT DO SO EVER? (Guitar, photography, boating, climbing, learning a piano, learning another language)

These are just A FEW of the things, which everyone of you must ask yourself. Because ultimately at the end, We are all going to die, one way or another. And to be brutally honest, a lot of people are going to regret how they lived their life. Not everything is about ""MORE MONEY"". And when you die, most probably you will be forgotten in 50 years. and that too if you become a celebrity. Otherwise, chances are you will be forgotten instantly. 

I have even seen people mentioning a ""BALANCE"". What balance? that you work for 6 days a week for 8 hours a day and then Sunday is a BALANCE? because that shit doesn't sound like a 50/50 balance to me. We sleep around 8 hours a day. And the rest of activities we SHOULD be doing in a day would constitute for around 7-8 hours (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Exercise, Errands). What you are left with is about 8 hours FREE. in which most of you only WORK. Exercise is totally forgotten. and even that 2 hours for exercise is given to work. 

Where is the time for yourself? to contemplate? to think? to feel about yourself? to do things you ACTUALLY want to do? 

I think even working for 4 hours a day is TOO MUCH. and should infact be only 2-3 hours. 

Money is just something the BANKS have created out of thin air, on which they ask you to pay an interest!!!. 

Have you thought about where the INTEREST money comes from which you pay??? . You guessed it, BANKS print them too. There is no Way out of the DEBT system. 

Only changes in your lifestyle and the way you feel about the world can result in self sustainable income and environment , where you can do things you want. 

Think about these things deeply.

Indian multimedia is horrendous.,102,560z3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/560z3n/indian_multimedia_is_horrendous/,40,1475720860,"So I'm part of an multimedia help group. We volunteer, helping people from all over the world with various software, but mostly Photoshop. People will post their images or animations and ask for help or feedback which we assist with. 

Now I've been doing this for more than 8 years and I'm educated in art and multimedia design, and classically trained in print advertising. I'm also a graphic designer. So I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm talking about, as do the other volunteers. 

Now, India. Whenever we get an upload from India it's almost always a case of the following:

1. The work is terrible. Over use of vignette, blur, exposure, saturation. 
2. It's a ridiculous portrait. For example, some guy sitting on the roof of a Ferrari. 
3. It's almost always men of various ages working on images of themselves. Really over-acted poses and stares. Just, shit really, no matter how it's analysed. 
4. Despite the fact that it's a helping forum with clear instructions to post AND ask your questions, Indian work is NEVER posted up with any questions. It's just posted and left like, *""Look at my awesome work!""*

Now I'm not biased or racist or generalising and if you think I am, I couldn't give a shit. This is based on 8 years of experience and the simple, statistical reality of almost all posts that come in to our site from India. No other country's people act this way on our site. Every one else mostly posts reasonably good work of general artistic topics and asks for help on some level. Not Indians. It's always vain, childish trash that none of us volunteers can even begin to understand, and when we offer feedback (which is usually not positive but always polite) we meet incredible resistance. Like how dare we critique work and offer suggestions to work that is posted to our free art critiquing website? It's not a gallery. It's a help and critique site made very clear by all the comments and critique publicly displayed, **as well as** the rules stated upon posting. 

Even if you look at our collective ban list right now. 248 people banned in 8 years. 233 of them registered as being from India. 

So what's up with this, India? How do I better understand what's going on here? How do I help you to help yourselves? Why is your art and photography so self-centred, vain, and forgive me, just plain terrible, and why won't you listen to **free**, professional advice on a free, professional advice website that **you came to**?",8

[RANT] Reservation Quotas.,116,3afiny,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3afiny/rant_reservation_quotas/,129,1434767963,"Everyday I wake up and regret being born in this country. I gave 3 competitive exams this year for different colleges. I was not selected in any of them. It's okay. I accept it.

Here's the part that grinds my gears. Reservation category. People getting selected on the basis of what their caste is  plain ridiculousness. Let me tell you these competitive exams were design aptitude and Film desgin (Specific area). I know a guy who got selected in a  college, he didn't even know what WHITE BALANCE in camera was until I told him (this was after 2 days of result declaration in which he was selected). The douche has Canon 5Dmark3. ""Photu me background blur ho raha hai, bc FB pe photography page kholo"" type dude. His father is super rich. Owns a jewelery shop.

Reservation quota does injustice with someone who knows better than the aforementioned prick. I am not saying I deserved that seat but.....fuck it man, this all just makes me super sad in general about India. 

Government sectors are not top notch as they should be because pile of reserved pricks got through who were only better taking bribes but nothing else. 

I am going to give entrance for FTII this year. In total 10 seats. In which 5 seats are reserved. Let's see how it goes for me. Considering the current situation at FTII with all the protests and all, this year too there will be no intake, a zero year. If this happens another slap to India's body of work. 2nd consecutive Zero year it will be in FTII.

EDIT:- NEW TO THIS SUB REDDIT. Didn't know this has been posted before also. Sorry for that. Anyway, sorry for the inconvenience. Kindly ignore or downvote the thread just for your satisfaction.

EDIT:- Hey, I also get the part where I didn't get the seat in unreserved category. I get it. I also accept it. But the 'whining like a little bitch' as some of you are calling is because of the stupid system. That prick with canon 5dmark3 didn't deserved that seat. Bas bc. He said ""jo photu me blur hota hai"" which is  ""SHadow depth of field"" makes me sad.

EDIT:- Adding extra point which is totally off topic but have surely done everything to bring my moral down. FUCKING RELATIVES. Fuck them all. I hope they die a painful death.

21 (F) Backpacking India solo in October! Seeking advice/tips!,37,4uu5hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uu5hv/21_f_backpacking_india_solo_in_october_seeking/,68,1469648139,"Hey Guys! Firstly, all my flights are booked. This isn't a ""is it safe"" thread :) I am well aware of the dangers and scams. I have done and am doing my research. I know what to wear etc. Thanks for your concern!



I'm flying into New Delhi on the 19th of October, staying for one night then probably heading off to Jaipur the next day. I would rather avoid going to Agra, and want to get out of Delhi ASAP so i'm going to skip the Taj/Save it for next time.




Im hoping to head to Pushkar after that, and then off to Udaipur and Jodhpur, after that I have no sort of sense of where to go next. I want to go in the general direction of the south (Goa, Kerala etc.) I'm hoping to spend 3-4 months travelling around. I should have $2000-2500 AUD to spend (100,488 - 125,606 Rupees) maybe even more. Any advice on time I should spend in certain cities etc. would be greatly appreciated. Im really into photography and video. Really keen on going to markets, trying lots of food, buying clothes, seeing some awesome architecture etc.



Would like some recommendations on: - Doing classes, yoga, massage, cooking etc. where to do them - Buying clothes, places to avoid or places to 'save space' for - Activities (like camel ride in Jaisalmer, which I probably wont be doing this time)



I want to know how to go about money; Should I get out a large amount before I go? Use my card? Are there many ATM's around? Whats a good system to have to avoid getting my money stolen.



Any other advice or anything would be cool. Also if you're going to be in Rajasthan around the same time let me know!

Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],181,4i91ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4i91ig/kota_district_collectors_letter_to_the_parents_of/,40,1462632239,"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

How to deal with corrupt misbehaving customs officers at the airport?,23,4fnw6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fnw6k/how_to_deal_with_corrupt_misbehaving_customs/,14,1461195081,"I am not an indian but I am posting on this sub because I know people in india also have to deal with same type of corruption.  I am currently studying in a foreign country and once per year I get a chance to see my family. Last time when I went back home I had two laptops with me. One of them was my personal laptop and the other one of my university(which I have to return back at the end of my degree). Some people had told me that they are not going to charge you tax if they are used laptops. But when I arrived at the airport they asked me to pay tax on the laptops. They asked me to pay 50 dollar import tax on the 2nd laptop. I told them that they were not new laptops but used ones. While I was talking to one of the officers another guy came from behind and started shouting at me. ""WHAT IS THIS ? OPEN YOUR SUITCASE. WHAT IS THAT ? WE KNOW YOU HAVE TWO MOBILES ALSO..."" . I realized later that they were only trying to pressure me into bribing them. Of course, I did not bribe them but I ended up paying 50 dollars on something I did not even own. Keep in mind that I am a student and 50 dollars is a lot of money for me. I come from a middle class family and my scholarship pays for my university.

This year I am traveling again. Of course, this time I will not take two laptops with me but I have to take some candies and presents for my family. I wanted to take a lot of presents for my mother but because of this type of behavior I am scared of taking anything. Is there any way to deal with these people without losing your hard earned money ? The presents I am going to take will be around 2000 rupees(which is the limit). Could be a bit more than 2000 rupees. How should I respond if they behave like that again ?",8
[askindia] Am I really thinking wild? Confused. [career help],20,7gdwwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7gdwwd/askindia_am_i_really_thinking_wild_confused/,7,1511996989,"I'm a 27 guy and currently working in a hectic job in a small town away from a big city with no like minded people around me or even friends to hang out. I'm stressed and with a lot of thoughts in my mind. One thought/idea ain't letting me sleep these days. I want to start a photography based business in a nearby big city. I've been in love for photography but since I've started working, I hardly get time. Don't have any like minded people around me, or even if, can't give much time. I've had a small business earlier which was unsuccessful but learnt a lot during college time. Now working for a year has got me a hang of how to deal with people, manage them, get results. 

Now coming back to my idea of photography and filmmaking business, it ain't any disruptive business but something I've loved. I have a small portfolio which ain't much impressive, not of any models in the photos but general landscape, street and travel. I don't intend to be the next fashion photographer either. So the idea is leave this work, get to the nearby city, start a photography firm with initially teaching the basics and advance of photography, not the costly ones but even college students which can afford. Side by side, also lectures from the well knowns in the field who might help me get some traction along with what I've been doing. I plan to get some amount of initial money from home for this. Pick up a few students, with some contacts, get some photography paid jobs. Get those students paid with some margin for me, get more contacts and  follow it up. The jobs I tend to initially get are concerts, photoshoots and even weddings. Photography instruments and cameras can be rented. A lot of things I feel I can do. 

But now the only fear is jumping out of my well paying hectic job at this age for something like this. How much harm will it do to my career if I fail out and if I want to go back to my work life again? How do I see the future when this field is jam packed with every photographer and film maker out there. I don't plan to bring anything different in photography but satisfied clients, good photographs and create a team which can deliver this with me. This all as happiness in what I will do and something belonging to me. 

I also thought of doing this after trying out for mba, as it might give me a cushion. Maybe help me out. But again confusing.

So how wild is this? I need some sane suggestions here, haven't asked my family or friends. 

I've not edited any part of this text, just raw, straight out of my confused mind. Please be gentle, already stressed and confused about all directions in career.

tl;dr: 27yo guy, hectic job, wants to leave for starting a photography business with not much experience and not a disruptive business but something just for happiness. Confused guy.",8

I have a friend who followed his passion of photography and is pretty good at it. He got a degree in photography.
