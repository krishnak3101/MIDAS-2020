Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",14,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,1555360902,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",3

"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",25,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,1548078786,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",3
Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,53,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,1555627392,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them?

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

For the history of British colonialism in India I've started with Shashi Tharoor's *Inglorious Empire*, but of course there's a lot more to India's genesis than British imperialism.

We really need to talk about Flairs.,103,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",3

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them.

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.

[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,159,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,1492863549,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",3
PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,43,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,1461362094,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

Well articulated anti congress Whatsapp forward. Bhakton ki nayi [p]eshkash,2,7zckca,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7zckca/well_articulated_anti_congress_whatsapp_forward/,5,1519307015,"


Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",32,3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,98,1440193031,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs

[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,74,3de8cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3de8cn/modpost_new_flairs_for_rindia_and_improving/,234,1437005483,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)

[R]Feedback thread the sequel. Results and announcements.,28,2o2rpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2o2rpl/rfeedback_thread_the_sequel_results_and/,256,1417579232,"Dear Subscribers,

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!

[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,52,3ecyjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,33,1437709097,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon.

"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",10,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,1467222673,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Any complications in future jobs because of absconding from workplace?,3,3eesdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3eesdr/any_complications_in_future_jobs_because_of/,7,1437741982,"A friend of mine quit his previous company and joined another org. But unfortunately he did not like it a bit. In a month and a half he got another offer, which is better. So he is planning to abscond from his current workplace(as the notice period is 3 months) and join the other org as early as possible.

BUT, what he has done is, he hasn't told the new org that he has already joined another org and will be absconding from there. All the documents for background verification are of his previous org.

So, is there going to be any complications in the future after he joins this new org? He is worried because he has got one month salary and PF from the company he joined recently but has not disclosed the same while getting another offer. He has told them that he is not working currently and can join immediately!!

The developed world should take the initiative, dramatically increase investment in Energy R&D and come up with cheaper alternatives that are sustainable for developing economies like ours. 
Here's the excerpt from his interview with The Atlantic. 
>..when you turn to India and say, “Please cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that’s really expensive, subsidized energy,” that’s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer.

>I’m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they’ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China’s defined into that term.

> I want to call up India someday and say, “Here’s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it’s also better.”

[NP] Which Tax Return to file if I'm both salaried and making money from side-gig?,5,6jnnbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6jnnbm/np_which_tax_return_to_file_if_im_both_salaried/,2,1498536793,"Hi, throwaway account.

Need some help / advice from you guys.

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

We have checked the internet but everything seems equally expensive. Does anyone know if there is a cheap reliable way to ship things to the UK by surface mail? (From Delhi or Udaipur)

The long and fascinating story of how Dadra and Nagar Haveli got integrated into India.,17,25ix5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25ix5m/the_long_and_fascinating_story_of_how_dadra_and/,2,1400088358,"India is a big, complicated country with a big, complicated history. This means that any reasonably efficient attempt at trying to make sense of Indian history must, unfortunately, gloss over the hundreds of thousands of little stories that went into making modern India. Take, for instance, the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

> *""On the night of July 22, 1954, a group of nearly fifteen volunteers of the United Front of Goans (UFG) under the leadership of freedom fighters Francis Mascarenhas and Vaman Desai assembled outside the border to discuss the details of the assault. They marched across the border and approached Dadra, around midnight. When they neared the police station, they recognised sub-inspector Aniceto Rosario, their archenemy. He was responsible for the ill treatment of UFG members in the police custody at Daman and they sought revenge. At that time, he was addressing a group of 100 to 150 villagers; warning them against the illegal entry by outsiders through their fields. They were also told that disobeying the orders would be met with serious consequences. The volunteers managed to crawl into the village, while some of them mixed with the locals assembled at the meeting. The remaining went round and began to close in from behind the police station.""*

Much violence followed. More [here](http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/how-18th-june-road-got-its-name). And in this newspaper clipping [here](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540724&id=wXUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sL4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673,3493515).

Two weeks later Nagar Haveli was also captured, and the liberators declared that the little enclave was now ""Free Dadra And Nagar Haveli"", an independent country, with no international recognition of course, but run by a pro-Indian government called the Varishtha Panchayat. Some time afterwards the Panchayat asked India for help to run the enclave. 
> *""In response to requests from the Varishta Panchayat and the Administrator of Nagar-Aveli, Dr. A. Furtado, who proposed to resign, the Government of India agreed to make available the services of a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service as the Administrator of those areas. Shri K. G. Badlani took over as the new Administrator with effect from 17 October 1960. It is also proposed to elect a new Panchayat to replace the present Panchayat which consists of nominees. This new Panchayat would act as the Legislative Council of the liberated areas.""*

From this Ministry of External Affairs report [here](http://mealib.nic.in/?pdf2487?000). (PDF)

Meanwhile the Portuguese government took India to the International Court of Justice. The court passed a judgement that upheld the Portuguese claim that its sovereign territory had been over-run, but then curiously passed another judgement that prevented the Portuguese from actually doing anything about the Indian 'invasion'.  Copy of the judgement [here](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/32/4521.pdf). (PDF)

Understandably, both countries insisted that the ruling went in their respective favour.

Thus for seven years, from 1954 to 1961, Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed in a state of political limbo, nicely helped along by the government of India and Mr. Badlani.

And then in 1961, after Portuguese India had fallen and been annexed by Indian forces, D&NH requested to be merged with India. The popular telling of what happened next is as follows: D&NH quickly created a legislature, that then elected IAS officer KG Badlani as Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli for just one day. That same day he signed over the territory to the Republic of India. And this handover was formalized with the tenth amendment to the Indian Constitution. Amendment details [here](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/NowHereThis/now-here-this-6/1076673-164.100.47.134/intranet/cai/a.pdf?c=66b2a0b7-a1c6-4faa-8c15-2659fdd94b72). (PDF)

I've not been able to source any documents to suggest that Badlani was actually made a ""Prime Minister For A Day"". But there is little doubt that he was, if only briefly, the head of state of a tiny little quasi-independent enclave in India before it was gobbled up by the republic.

And thus, my email-friends, was a nation built.

The home isolation has caught up to me and I'm wondering what it's like for people in India who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years.

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

Over the last few years, I have been earning a lot more money than before and I want to use some of it to help others who aren't as fortunate.

Currently I am sponsoring the education for 2 siblings with a single mother and few other small donations which I don't even need twice to say yes to. 

Most appeals for financial help that I come across on social media are well within my means to help, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to spend my money. 

This post  is mostly to help me decide what kind of efforts I should be funding. So I can set aside funds for such causes and whenever I come across an appeal, I shouldn't have to think about whether I should donate or how much etc. 

I would like to donate to things that can significantly change people's lives for the better. (Beyond just helping them survive/maintain status quo.)

Things I don't feel comfortable sponsoring, 
 - Expensive school education(pre-classX) for under privileged kids. (Expensive = 20-30k per annum, I don't mind funding someone's college education for a lot moret, but I feel  it's super expensive for school fees.) 
 - Expensive medical treatment for strangers with low chances of survival. (I'm conflicted on this, but my thinking the same amount of money can help a lot more people instead of feeding into medical industry profits. I may think differently if it was a family member or close friend.)

Looking to hear your views on how/what causes to donate to. Or share your thinking around this issue..

Or if you know any low profile people/organisations doing good work, please share information here.

[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,16,di5x69,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/di5x69/askindia_why_do_we_have_so_much_distrust_of/,16,1571163930,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.",3

So I found out that my wife is cheating. I am 39 and she is 33 and we have two kids, a girl and a boy. I am very upset. The marriage is broken irreparably. I want out.

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. 

Knowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs. I just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently. What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.

I'd like to have full custody of our children. Does anyone know under what conditions will I be able to get that?

Thanks for all your responses. Few were helpful, few disturbing and few others distasteful. Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened.

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all.

I'm going to Italy later this month and I'm really confused about what I should do about currency. I'm from Bangalore and I've asked around. I get different opinions about exchanging.

UPDATE: I ended up getting an ICICI Bank Multi currency travel card because:

1. ICICI Bank is my primary bank account and the process was quick.

2. I didn't see significant differences in exchange/conversion rates across other banks.

3. ICICI allows me to recharge my travel card through my iMobile app, even from abroad. This was a huge plus.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

[AskIndia] Can Dawood Ibrahim be a Free Man as per current state of Indian Judiciary?,10,dic1m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dic1m6/askindia_can_dawood_ibrahim_be_a_free_man_as_per/,1,1571192633,"
Before anybody comments shit instead of discussion, 

A) I'm a 5th Generation Maharashtrian (that I know of) and 3rd Generation Mumbaikar aged 41. So obviously I'm not a Muslim or a Pakistani posting here. Its sad that it has come down to this that one has to prove his Nationalism for any freeminded discussion. We all let it happen, it's our fault not of Bhakts.

B) Not a Dalit but a Chitpavan Brahmanvad, so I can claim My Hinduism to any Hindutva turd and tell them to back the fuck off, in real world. I'll show my clout and power to those, if and when need arises. Because that's not relevant here and i'm just clearing this for stupid and ignorant Bhakts.

Now, since that part is cleared, I definitely am not a supporter or a fan of Dawood or his chain of gangsters ever. Dawood was just a name whom every gangster wannabe wanted to have that kind of power that he had in his time of late 80s and 90s. Everyone as a kid used to mock himself as Bhai or Dawood gang leader just for fun. That was the kind of cult Dawood had in his prime, the mumbai underworld king. Look at any big international gangsters stories and Dawood was no different. From actors to politicians, businessmen and builders, Gold and Diamond merchants and every small or big scale citizens of India was affiliated with Dawood once directly or indirectly. During that period, only the Law enforcement and Cops gave actual shit to pin his empire down and common citizens never gave a fuck about it, like how the common people are doing now but it is pointless since he is overseas or Pakistan or wherever he can easily travel.

I'm positive that he had hands on Mumbai serial blasts, everybody thinks that because some cops were sure of it based on tips and infos. But that's that. Finito. No hard evidence to back up the cops theory cuz it's obvious he didn't plant those bombs himself. His minions did. And those minions of his used some 3rd party to do the dirty work, similar to lower class poor needy should shitbag. So one cannot even prove that it links to Dawood based on hard evidence. There is none. It's only a feeling that we think Dawood did it. No matter how much We as citizens believe that he did it, our Judiciary will still not be convinced and will let him go Scott free. Because it happened 25 years ago. Ofcourse Dawood will not come down and will confess, not will his supporters or even his enemies will do it too. Because even his enemies hates cops and law and order. A common ground between every rival gangster is that to keep cops at Bay. So nobody will ever come out and will be a witness. Chotta Rajan? Hahaha....he was once a part of Dawood gang, so whatever he will claim will come down to him as well. To be honest, he is no good use to the courts as he himself is a criminal with so many cases against him.

Ofcourse he has knowledge of Dawood a whereabouts, but how much really does he know since 5 years have passed and Dawood is still nowhere to be traced. Even if he is located, how will anybody bring him to India? And even if he is nabbed, what will be the charges? How will he be put behind bars cuz so far not a single chargesheet has been made against him, criminal or otherwise. He is still well protected by his old friends who are old politicians, actors and businessmen who are much too afraid that whatever criminal charges will be put against Dawood, it will all be linked to them, one or the other ways.

So how is he a Terrorist, Criminal and Most Wanted? When in reality nobody wants him in India or else all hell will break loose once he starts to reveal all the dirty secrets. Which current politician wants that? Why would these Rich people wants a noose on their neck to bring Dawood back? To end Terrorism for good, these Rich people will sacrifice their 29 years ""good"" image?

Another thing is, what Dawood did back then, is the very same Sadhvi Pragya was charged for. Serial blasts that is. Now she is in Modi government. Because the Lawyers got her out. Because it's Lawyers job to defend. And they won't do the same for Dawood if the price is right? So it is safe to say Dawood of he gets nabbed and sent back to India, he will get out Scott free. It's only that the BJP has put an image that since he is a Muslim and is in Pakistan so he is a Terrorist. What they will never say is , Dawood is a free man in India even today but if Dawood chooses to reveal all the secrets, no politicians, Actors, Actresses, Businessmen images will be safe. And he would have done that if he was really going to get nabbed. But he is most definitely not. Our CBI is smart enough to get Chidambaram and all, but not him? Please.

[AskIndia] Is there an Indian equivalent of Hikikomori taking place in our society?,270,a7m150,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7m150/askindia_is_there_an_indian_equivalent_of/,129,1545251798,"Hikikomori is a social phenomenon observed in Japan. It's a case of social withdrawal, where young people just stay indoors for years and years. They don't go out, or work (becoming NEETS - Not in Education, Employment, or Training), or socialize IRL. Their whole lives just revolve around the apartments they stay in (some alone, some with their parents).

Their reasons can vary - fear of societal disappointment, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, etc. It has much to do with the work culture of Japan, with its insanely long working hours, high expectations, conformity, and rigid social rules. I'd suggest reading about [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and checking out some of the IAMAs done on it. And the anime, Welcome to the NHK.

**Now, the point: would you say that this is happening to some degree in India as well?**

Some of the factors that cause this are common here. Japan is very different from India so let's get past that bit. However, we do have similarities. Indians are [increasingly overworked](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/) with most of our workers [burning out](https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/) from unhealthy conditions. [Indians are lonely](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134) and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the actual problem that we have no dating culture in India, and the fact that most men are unlikely to be well-socialized with women - who then watch movies about romance and start to wonder why their lives don't match up with what's on screen. Indian male loneliness is crippling, and prevalent, in my opinion.

Like Japan, we also have strong family structures, so that an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn't uncommon. In fact, in Kerala, I would say every family has one. There are cousins and uncles - people who for unexplained reasons end up doing nothing but staying at home. We have people who strike out into depression after failing the IIT-JEEs and AIEEEs or back papers, who stay home and seldom if not never come out. I'm sure many have posted on this subreddit as well. 

**One strange parallel I feel we have with the Hikikomori is the IAS aspirant**. There is a degree of social isolation and staying-at-home-for-years that happens with both IAS aspirants and Hikikomori that really strikes me. OFC not all IAS aspirants are the same but I know one shut-in and one on his way to becoming one, perhaps. Anyway this is just my view.

What do you think, though? Are a lot of young Indians locking themselves away from society as well? Have you ever felt the urge? Any discussion appreciated. 

I write as someone who's been unemployed for a good year now and I can feel the yawning chasm of social reclusion approach. Most of my year was at home, though I took gaps to travel. This was more a recluse from my career than from socializing, though I do feel I've been meeting fewer new people than I normally do.

I do believe that his is happening, though quietly. In a country like ours, it's easy to be forgotten.",3

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

Please, help and post your knowledge and experiences.

RSS hasn't adjusted its core ideology to be ethnically inclusive, instead it doubles down with Hindi as a National Language and a North Indian cultural soft power(TBF these issues always plagued the Central Govt but it feels like Hindutva ideology is adding jet fuel to the dormant embers of Hindi-Hindu Majoritarianism).

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

**On a Sidenote**: Has the Gandhian idea of India failed? Everything is so hyper&jingoistic these days. A mere mention of ethnic groups existing in India seems to trigger outrage&accusations of anti-nationalism. ",3

Non-news should be a thing in today's world of instant news and instant shit. Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.
7. Yesterday I bought 1KG really good tomatoes for 11 bucks.

I'll add any unremarkable, utterly boring, inconsequential events that I can recollect. Share your non-news and get back to your choice of slavery.",3

^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

"[AskIndia] Guidance regarding DTU, NSUT & IGDTU",14,cdeteu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cdeteu/askindia_guidance_regarding_dtu_nsut_igdtu/,12,1563207681,"*I have already posted this query on India_Academia but haven't got any reply. *

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process & Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical & Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical & Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production & Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

Kindly suggest edits to the above order. 


I am looking at a Software profile job after college, so she will study software no matter what branch she gets.",3
[AskIndia] What song is this ?,5,comakt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/comakt/askindia_what_song_is_this/,6,1565493383,"Often when I think of home there is a particular Hindi pop a song plays in my head that was popular in the early 2003, the year I left home. I can recall only one line from the song and hum the tune of the same bit and nothing more. Over the years, I, for the life of me can't find the title of the track or singer. I've trawled through a several 2000s pop songs compilation on youtube, lyrics websites without much luck.

What I can remember: 

* **Genre**: Hindi pop song
* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)
* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A ""hit"" song during the month of CBSE board exam)
* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. 
* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. 

That's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. 

**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.

Edit: Added 2001 to year.",3

Leaving all the privacy concerns aside and various technical concerns aside like IPv4 to IPv6 migration (that has been covered in detail in a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/?st=jwpse9tu&sh=4ffb9a21) ), I want to delve into the more mundane or trivial shitty things that come along with Jio Giga connection  

1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating  

2) of course the landline connection is itself a pain in the ass. fucking takes too long between consecutive rings, one might think it even got disconnected after the first ring  

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  

enough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  

 * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  
 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",3

Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

[AskIndia] Situation with parents - Am I wrong?,62,as8cj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/as8cj5/askindia_situation_with_parents_am_i_wrong/,43,1550595226,"27/M/Mumbai/Single/Only Son. Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

&#x200B;

Any other general pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance.

Troubled, Yellow!

&#x200B;

TL;DR : 27M,Single, Live with parents in Mumbai. Parents keep fighting. Are controlling. Have big egos. Considering options in life without hurting them.

It is locked, fairly simpering in nature, and lacks any controversy section.

The equivalent entry on [Dhirubhai Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani) is not locked but is also fairly blank in its description. 

Wikipedia is supposed to a neutral entry for human knowledge curated by the community. In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.

I'm not the first to mention this. One Quora user (in a post titled ""How corrupt is Mukesh Ambani?
"") described his attempt to edit the page and how it was stumped by higher-level editors.

In the case of India's richest and most powerful person, it is understandable that certain information is undesirable in the public realm. However, that does not mean we should bow our heads.

Finding out anything about the Ambani's is notoriously difficult. Sure, you could follow newspaper headlines over the least few years but they have a tendency of being fickle. Remember when Ambani's kid mowed someone over in an Aston Martin? Or when the family was involved in a [bitter feud](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890831-bombay-dyeing-reliance-feud-ril-executive-arrested-on-charge-of-conspiring-to-kill-nusli-wadia-816444-1989-08-31) with Nusli Wadia (that culminated in a murder charge)?

The saga of Ambani is too vast to remember everything. Only a person who reads the paper every day for the last 75 years will know their true history and even then he knows just a fraction. I admit, I don't know enough. But I do know that there is a concerted attempt to control information about Reliance.

We see it in [Reliance ownership of the media](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-big-five-the-media-companies-that-the-modi-government-must-scrutinise-to-fulfill-its-promise-of-ending-crony-capitalism), in their purchase and regulation of our satire ([they even bought out FakingNews.com](https://www.medianama.com/2013/05/223-firstpost-fakingnews/) in its early days - understanding early that such sites could be far more critical than investigatory journalists and far more apt as well). We see it in [near billion dollar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-row-anil-ambani-files-rs-5000-crore-defamation-suit-against-national-herald-congress-leader/articleshow/65546040.cms) defamation cases. We see it when books that try to tell this story [are banned from being published in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Polyester_Prince).

You know what is happening. I know what is happening. We all know it. Anyone on the street will tell you this and that about how Ambani pulls every string. And I will be the first to be realistic. 

**However, an open ledger of information does not have the same weakness as a media organisation that has to pay salaries.** 

Use a proxy and edit. Cite your sources well. What are you doing wrong when it is done in the name of the truth? But before this can even happen, don't we need to get past that lock?

To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page. 

Honestly, if I knew enough and wasn't afraid myself, I'd make the edits. But I think there might be smarter and better people on here who could give me added perspective. I don't have experience editing Wikipedia and I believe in this happening to a fair standard.

I think I can speak for many when I say that it's what I turn to when shit gets dark. Looking back over a decade, I can see that as long as I've been depressed I've had some anime to turn to on the side. 

I've never really become an Otaku though the last year has been tough and perhaps I've been on the path, as a NEET of sorts. Either ways, I felt there would be some here who would empathize.

One of the challenges of discussing anime is that everyone has their own personal list of must-recommends, and not many seem interested in your own lists. I guess it's like YouTube, everyone has their space and curations.

I've just started watching EVA. It feels nice to go back to the 90s for a change. And while I always perceived this as a 'weeb' anime for some reason, I watched a few YouTube videos on why people love it and realized it's sort of about depression as well. Four episodes in and I can see how compelling this show is.
 
The last anime I fell in love with was Samurai Champloo (which introduced me to Nujabes and the genre that evolved to become Low Fi). I watched that show for the music and the smooth storytelling. I wanted to be like Mugen - badass hardened street rat who's seen the world and is wise to it. But also like Jin, someone who has a deep inner calm. And a bit like Fuu, who creates the adventure, and who knows it's about the journey over the destination.

[AskIndia] Why are Indians so oblivious to traffic rules in their own country?,36,aubnzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aubnzl/askindia_why_are_indians_so_oblivious_to_traffic/,29,1551066236,"Is there any particular reason as to why Indians are so cautious when it comes to breaking traffic rules when they go and live abroad? But on the other hand people living in India itself seem to give zero shit about following any traffic rule whatsoever. I have even come across people who on being asked to put on the seat belt reply with 'There's no traffic police in this area, so it's alright'

Isn't the entire point of having traffic rules to avoid accidents and major delays in transportation? And yet everyone seems to be completely oblivious to this and then start cussing at random people with their arse seated in the car wondering how it happened in the first place. Literally no one is exempt from this phenomenon - rickshaws tuck themselves in everywhere, bikes try to slip between vehicles, almost all car owners leave little to no space between consecutive vehicles.

No one seems to grasp the concept of staying in their own lane, if people were caught breaking the signal or speeding above the allowed limit everyone would get stopped one by one - it's just a crazy shit show. I have had several occasions where I had to personally point out to the traffic police themselves that vehicles are breaking the red light while I was crossing the road. Am I really expected to be okay with this?

You can say that many youngsters are to blame, but I don't see any elder people following a lot of rules either. It's only when someone goes through a major accident themselves, even after which they will follow only certain rules selectively so as to avoid harm to self.

I am looking for a more constructive answer than 'Because you can bribe the traffic police' I am also not looking forward to any of those 'You need to man up' bs comments. This is an entirely separate topic altogether.",3

As of now I have two years of workex, and an acceptance from a top 10 MBA college (1.6LPM Hojaega in a few years). My father however has his own project management consultancy, and is suggesting I join it.
I enjoy the consultancy bit, and the engineering part, but it doesn't pay as well as a Top MBA job would. So now I am confused, primarily because :
1. Dad's company = My company, plus staying at home (I've had loneliness induced anxiety before)  is a big thing.
2. MBA has a huge loan attached (25L+interest) which I need a lot of time to pay off.
3. Even if I stay home, I'll have to get some specialization in my field of engineering. So more padhai, along with work.
4. I can always work and make the consultancy bigger, expand it. 
5. From various people that I've talked to, once you're making good money, it's difficult to come back and start working for yourself. 

Tldr : Top 10 MBA college vs Baap ka kaam

Edit : Made it to a Top 5 college today.

""Where is your native place""

""Where are you from?""

These are common questions but I have no answer to it. I grew up in a different country, had my schooling in a different city, have my parents from two different parts of Kerala and have my (recently) permanent address in a different city.

I could say I am from the city I live in and have my family home in, but I've not lived here more than a year and know nothing about it. I could say I'm from the city I was born in , but again, I know nothing about it. When festivals happen here, I see them for the first time. I don't have any local friends.

I could say I am from the metropolis that I spent the largest chunk of my life in but then I am not Kannadiga.

I could say I am from the foreign country I grew up in and had my childhood from but then LOL that country doesn't give anybody citizenship. And I don't want it even if they paid me for it.

The more I think about it, the stranger the question of where you're from becomes, if you, like me, have no fixed roots. Where are you from if your parents come from two different cities? Where are you from if you spent many years in Bangalore but feel no affiliation to one city over another? Where are you from if you don't speak the local dialect and language of the place you are from?

inb4 ""I am from India"" because using that in a conversation is going to get you significant eyeroll. That only works on passport officers.
