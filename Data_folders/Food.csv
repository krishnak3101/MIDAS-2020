Order status was showing Delivery executive collected food and is on the way but from tracking his bike was showing off the route and it got delayed by 10-15 min so I called executive and he said he is on the way and will meet me in 2 min my apartment gate. I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion. 

What do you think of it guys ?

TLDR : Order got delivered late, I suspect food was taken away, No confirmation of order deliverey, had to cancel myself despite receiving package. Got refund but feel something is fishy.",2

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona.

Now, we are rushing to the grocery stores and fighting over trivial things like paper to wipe our backs. 

There is a quote in the movie Interstellar:

*”We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that.
Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us”*

It almost feels like that our systems, our unity, our spirit, our patience and our human sensitivities are all getting tested at the same time. The Hope that there is another tomorrow keeps us all moving and fighting. 

It however goes without saying the C-scare has truly shown the fragility of our existence. We need to pause. We need to think what is truly important. We need to focus. It is time to rethink. We have not found another worlds. We have not found a way to escape yet. 

This is it. Let’s push this out and remember to not go back to our arrogant ignorant selves. Else, we will waste a perfect disaster to evolve as Humans first.

We will survive this. However, why waste an adversity. Let’s use it to change the course of future.",2

A long read but definitely provides much food for thought! Would like to know your thoughts on this.,0,fsagi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsagi8/a_long_read_but_definitely_provides_much_food_for/,6,1585678744,"A comprehensive summary and analysis by Jaideep Varma. 

""If you're one of those who cannot bear an alternative opinion, please don't burden your dainty mind further. But if you're fine with wading into a fresh perspective that has no pretensions of being the last word, some of you might just find this constructed case below worth your time. 

It seeks to examine if there has been an international overreaction to Coronavirus, entirely in synch with the polarised world this virus was born into. 

Let's proceed fact-by-fact. (All stats from the public domain; have aggregated to actually provide a conservative estimate. References in first comment). I've tried to simplify this as much as I can, for easy comprehension. 

1) 
The following are the fatality rates of Coronavirus in different age-groups: 

0-9 yrs - 0%; 10-19 yrs - 0.2%; 20-29 yrs - 0.2%; 
30-39 yrs - 0.2%; 40-49 yrs - 0.4%; 50-59 yrs - 1.4%; 
60-70 yrs - 3.8%; 70-79 yrs - 8%; 80+ yrs - 15%. 

So, even an infected person of over 80 years has an 85% chance of survival. It is important to understand that Coronavirus affects mostly people with pre-existing conditions, which is why the fatality rate really starts notably increasing from the age-group 50-59. 

(Also, the rumours about more men dying are true; the proportion is roughly 70:30. Given that this is a respiratory disease, this discrepancy has been linked to smoking by some experts, not to any specific targeting by the virus).

2) 
The following is the approximate outcome for infected people: 

95% infected people need 2 weeks to recover with no medicine, from home. 
5% need hospitalisation.
2% need ICU.
1% need ventilator.

So, the vast majority of infected people can just recover by staying at home, with no medicine. Even seemingly well-educated people don't seem to grasp this properly. Please hold on to this fact. 

The big concern for authorities is for a large number of cases to be in that 5% when there are fewer hospital beds available, and especially in that 1% where there is a considerable shortage of ventilators.  

3) 
In warmer countries, for some reason that is still not clear, the fatality rate is considerably lower than other places so far, and the overall fatality rate of about 4.5%. 

Brazil: 2.7%; Malaysia: 1.2%; Thailand: 0.4%; Saudi Arabia: 0.3%; India: 2.3%. (The two outliers are Indonesia and Philippines with 8.4% and 6.7% but experts have stated these figures have emerged due to very low testing in that part of the world; more testing would lower the fatality rates considerably). 

Low testing is a big problem in India as well. However, there are no reports of people with symptoms crowding hospitals as there are in many other countries. And it is important to understand that if there are indeed many latent cases as is feared, that would actually bring DOWN the fatality rate. 

Death tallies can't be faked and it is hard to hide the dead - that is the key number, and that is 20 over ten-odd days. Even with limited testing, the average number of new Indian cases is in the region of 100-120 a day; it has been like that for a week. Which means there is absolutely no evidence of exponential community spread till date in India. And that has so far been the case in all of the warm weather countries. 

4) 
In human history, untreated illnesses and unvaccinated viruses have the following as fatality rates: 

Rabies - 99%; AIDS 80-90%; EBOLA 87%; Smallpox - 65%; Bubonic/Pneumonic Plague 52%; Tetanus 50%; Cholera 47%; TB 43%; Chickenpox 30%; Typhoid 15%; SARS 11%; Spanish Flu 10%; Zika Virus 8%; Yellow Fever 7.5%; Diphtheria 7.5%; Coronavirus 4.5%; Measles 2.5%; Swine Flu 2.1%. 

So, Coronavirus has among the lowest fatality rates in history.

This is the first virus to travel so far (199 countries) in this new world, polarised more than ever before in human history by social media and mobile technology. A global virus in an intensely globalised world should not be a surprise at all, spreading during peak travel season, both, domestically in China and internationally. The virus itself is more contagious than most other viruses that came before, but not by such a great margin. 

There have been many pandemics in human history, many of them far, far worse than this one (in terms of fatalities). But the reaction worldwide has been fraught with anxiety and panic in the face of the uncertainty of having no cure yet. 

Incidentally, uncertainty is a condition that people in this new world (mobile social media) deal with far worse than any previous generation in history - this has been well documented and discussed in recent times. Has that had a greater say this time than the pandemic itself? 

5) 
WHO estimates deaths arising from common flu to be between 290,000 to 650,000 people every year, at a fatality rate of roughly 1%. Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 so far in about four months, with very limited testing in many parts of the world (truer testing would lower its 4.5% fatality rate considerably). 

Also, two recent studies done in Italy comprehensively show that ""less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, or persons without pre-existing chronic diseases."" Which means, in the face of so much focus on Coronavirus, it is not clear in many places ""who died FROM the Coronavirus and who died WITH the Coronavirus"". 

Incidentally, between the five winter seasons in Italy between 2013 and 2017, there were 68,000 deaths from common flu. That means an average of about 4,500 deaths a month during the winter season (where February is the peak month). This has very emphatically been a trend in the last decade in Italy anyway - of elderly people dying in droves from flu during the winter months. Does Italy's death toll of approximately 9,000 in three months due to Coronavirus seem high in light of this? Especially when the Italians themselves are not sure in many cases if the patients are dying of Coronavirus or merely with it. 

The US, who have just overtaken Italy on number of Coronavirus cases, have an even more sordid record when it comes to the common flu. In the 2017/28 flu season, the US registered 61,000 deaths from flu. That's an average of over 10,000 deaths a month! In the 2018/19 flu season, there were 34,200 deaths - that's 5,700 deaths a month. So far, there have been about 1500 deaths from Coronavirus in the US. 

It is worth repeating this - the Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 in four months, while an average of WHO's tally of common flu deaths every year is about 39,000 deaths PER MONTH and critically, within EXACTLY the same patient base. And recent studies in Italy have found that it is not entirely clear if many of the patients actually died from the Coronavirus. 

This is a huge point that will no doubt be explored in great depth by the medical fraternity in months to come. But it is worth thinking about this - what would happen if there was intense 24-hour media scrutiny worldwide on the common flu deaths - at the rate of about 39,000 a month worldwide ? What would it do to our minds? If we discount the absence of uncertainty (as common flu has prescribed cures, which is why the fatality rate is low) would it not lead to a similar brand of panic that we see now? (This disproportionate panic is apparent in the smallest things; like, despite WHO and the American Surgeon General categorically saying that masks are useless unless a person has definite symptoms, there has been a frenzy for them.) 

Obviously, this is not at all a case to downplay the Coronavirus pandemic. It has to be combatted, and the key ways are well-known by now - social distancing, regular hand-washing, quarantines, and closing down travel. A lockdown in places where there are signs of community spreading is definitely desirable. Even as a precaution, this is a good option, for a limited period.   

Beyond dispensations and politics, this is about worldwide frenzy and alarmism, accentuated by a mainstream media that comprehensively leans towards worst-case scenarios in the name of erring on the side of safety. And many people are unable to adjust their mind to the fact that those are worst-case scenarios and that ""experts"" in most fields do not even agree with each other, and so get stuck on pessimistic, and often outlandish views as the most credible one (which in turn gets perpetuated). It is a perfect pointer to our times how so many react violently to that singular view being questioned, and alternative views derisively dismissed without its facts examined at all. (This does make one wonder about climate-change alarmism as well. For example, it is worth remembering that before William Nordhaus won the Economics Nobel in 2018, climate change anti-alarmists were equated with climate deniers.) 

But here's the kicker. Why is it that the far higher death tallies of flu in recent years, in exactly the same patient group as that of Coronavirus, never got the kind of attention that the Coronavirus tallies have received? Could it have something to do with the largely modest economic and social classes getting affected by the common flu? And the travelling/ jet-setting classes of people who are affected by the Coronavirus? Couple this class consciousness (and the blatant sacrificing of the worker class in some countries, like India) with the fear mongering that the political class relies on to subjugate the masses, at a time when leadership standards all around the world are at an all-time low than ever before in human history, and we have a lethal combination. 

Yes, Coronavirus has changed the world but is it because of the pandemic itself or because of how all of us have responded to it?""",2

How do I explain it, not only I feel burning sensation in my mouth and chest but it also feels uncomfortable after eating & I have a hard time digesting it. Maybe it’s because of genetics. By spice I don’t mean just chilli but other spices too.

Back in home, all things are cooked without spices. Wedding ceremonies become a nightmare sometimes. Fortunately, I’ve a sweet tooth to make up for it and enjoy sweet things in general. 

After 12th I moved out and went to Kota for medical preparation. And food in my hostel was absolute nightmare (but average according to others), I suffered from acidity & sickness the entire year. Situation didn’t improve all even in my college life with the limited things I can eat. Also, I can’t eat outside with the few friends I have, unless it’s McDonald’s or KFC, which is rare since most of time they hang out, they always prefer dinner at some restaurant instead. Eating just Hakka noodles & salad isn’t worth it.

Edit: *I’ve read that our taste buds and nerves use various proteins (called TRP channels) to detect various substances that give most spices their distinctive taste. Most of these proteins are activated by many different spices. Our spice tolerance depends on our genetics, people have mutations of these proteins which influence our final sensation of spices since most food have blend of different spices. People who have TRPV1 protein mutated they’re less susceptible to capsaicin in chillies (chemical compound that causes burning sensation after eating chilli).*",2

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

India Will Become Less Religious If We Had Social Security and Free Healthcare,219,g3mehq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3mehq/india_will_become_less_religious_if_we_had_social/,121,1587240047,"The most common human anxieties are around the basics: food, shelter, health. In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

What do y'all think? Is this a reasonable view?

Edit: And if Modi realises this, he will ensure that we will never have any form of social security or healthcare.",2

More than 1 lakh people are stranded at the UP Delhi border. Who the fuck will look after them if they contract the disease? Who the fuck will care about them? 

These people are at many times the only breadwinners of the family. Can we be so ignorant, that we readily allow entire families of poor to get destroyed? Some  owners of factories, contractors have simply haven't paid these workers and simply turned a blind eye towards these people. 

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

Everybody is praising the Indian government on how efficiently they brought an early lockdown. They don't realize what the poor are going through, simply because the society doesn't care about them. 

Please think  again, if you think my thoughts have political origin.",2

We are being asked to perform antics.  
I want to know about availability of PPE for doctors, nurses and health staff.  
I want to know how many hospitals, ventilators, ICUs are ready.  
I want to know if COVID19 testing will be made accessible and affordable.  
I want to know about Govt arrangements to feed the daily wagers, homeless, the unemployed.  
I want to know who and how the food and medical needs of the migrant workers are being addressed.  
I want to know how farmers will cope with this distress.  
I want to know how women will escape domestic violence trapped in their homes.  
I want to know what is being done to enable trans persons and sex workers to survive this period of lockdown.

Spicy food causing upper back pain? Myth or reality?,9,f12urb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f12urb/spicy_food_causing_upper_back_pain_myth_or_reality/,4,1581247602,"I'm a traveller who arrived in India just over a week ago. Since then, I only had Indian food, mostly street food and cheap restaurants. I'm already getting used to the spiciness unlike at the beginning.

Two days ago I started having acute upper back pain between my shoulder blades. Pain when turning neck, especially downwards. Feeling of being ""stuck"". I'm personally thinking I got a bad knot from sleeping in a weird position + poor posture.

Now, everybody has different unprofessional diagnosis and advice for that kinda thing; muscle sprain, pulled, knot. The most original I've heard is that all the spices somehow build up gas that can get stuck in the back; should go away over a few days or with a muscle relaxant. Apparently that would be a pretty common phenomenon in India, including amongst Indians themselves. To me that sounds pretty pseudoscience, can't any source about it anyway. But I'm curious what Indians have to say about it. Is this really a common saying?",2

I wasted so much money in these apps because I felt hungry and instead of looking for an alternative I just ordered either fancy food or cheap foods( Due to their attractive 50% offers). 



See the budget for alternatives like

Maggi (Rs 12)
Eggs (Rs 5-7)
Bread (Rs 30)
Tomato sauce large ( Rs 100)
Mayoneese large(Rs 110)
Chilly sauce large (Rs 110)
Rice Batter (Rs 40/kg) with Idly powder(Rs 10)[For South Indians]
Butter (Rs 50-150)
Milk (500 ml for Rs 25)
Peanut Butter (Rs 70)
Any Health mix/syrups
Frozen French Fries ( Rs 250/kg)




With these items you can make small dishes like 

Egg maggi
Bread omelette
Bread toast
Butter toast
Normal omelettes
Egg popcorn 


Although this may sound popular,it helps you to avoid ordering at late nights if you go for these alternatives or else you might end up spending Rs 150 for your cravings.",2

To the best of my knowledge and assessment of the situation, we're about to get deluged in a wave of cases for which it is impossible to be adequately prepared. Many will die. The govt is trying, but whatever they arrange will never be enough for the general population to get off lightly. 

People panic buying food and medical supplies have created a vicious cycle so much so that I doubt if there will be enough meds for the frontline workers. This could potentially lead to more deaths in the healthcare workers, that could secondarily translate to a higher death rate in the patients.

People not taking quarantine seriously. Their actions today will kill many. Mostly their old, young, and sick family members, neighbours, or roommates.

In the meantime there's talk of having us work in makeshift corona wards from where we won't be able to return home. We'll probably stay on campus in recently emptied undergrad hostels. 

I don't mind working on campus and not coming home for weeks, maybe months. I don't mind dying too much either. ( I'm not super high-risk comorbidity-wise. I'm young. I run. But the stress is making me relapse into my smoking habit, and who knows what that might mean with this infection!) But the one thing that scares me shitless is that I don't know who will take care of my dogs at home. 

I hope I'm proved wrong in the coming weeks.

To negate the fatalism, if you're inside, avoiding ALL outside contact, you'll probably be able to delay infection to such time when we'll be better prepared to fight this thing with real world patient data, maybe new meds or even vaccines. Also death rates are generally low for young and fit patients.",2

Please note, he said ' prevention and cure' and not 'treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'palliative treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'help reverse the effects'.
