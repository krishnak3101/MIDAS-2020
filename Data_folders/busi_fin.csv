Advice for an Aussie promoting their business in India? Business/Finance,22,em8hu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/em8hu3/advice_for_an_aussie_promoting_their_business_in/,12,1578598858,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I hope you don't mind me posting this here for some advice! I'm a teacher from Sydney, Australia and I've just started my own online business. I want to start building a customer base in India first because I have worked with a lot of Indian children here in Australia and I always have a very positive relationship with them and their families. I also feel that our countries have a good friendship!

&#x200B;

Anyway, my product is digital and subscription based and I'm trying to work out the best way to promote it to parents and schools in India. I'll keep it as vague as possible so it doesn't come across like a promotion here, but I haven't been able to find reliable answers to some questions in my research:  


1. Is 400 Rs per month a reasonable price for an online subscription? I want to make it affordable for as many families as possible.
2. What are the most effective forms of advertising to reach parents? I'm on a limited budget and putting a lot of my time into my products, so I want to make sure I'm choosing the right advertising channels.

Thank you all so much for reading my post and any insight you can offer :)",6

I can't get over Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor,353,a5ewag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5ewag/i_cant_get_over_shaktikanta_das_being_appointed/,114,1544618818,"I flaired this as Business/Finance. I guess it should be Politics and Non Politics as well.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything! As if demo isn't a good example of that.",6
"“India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.”",2,d931fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/,0,1569445691,"*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**",6

"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",383,fv9ifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,56,1586098195,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",6
"Since some people actually believe Mamata is worse than Modi, lets's see how she compares to the other CM candidates from the other parties of the state.",17,g44szk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g44szk/since_some_people_actually_believe_mamata_is/,61,1587316954,"###Adhir Chowdhury, Congress


I actually dont mind him. He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently. The issue is with Congress. They were last in power in the state in 1977 under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent. [My own relative from my mom's side was tortured, he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today]
After losing to CPM at the start of their 33 year old rule on Bengal, only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in 1997. So for 20+ years Congress is the most irrelevant big 4 party in the state. 
Since 2011 they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power, a secondary to a CPM/INC coalition under a CPM CM.


###Surja Kanta Mishra, CPM

A Physician by profession, he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders, the Party line decide his politics.  So again, the issue is with the Party, CPM. 

Now i am gonna [quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffqi79/is_mamata_government_in_west_bengal_as/fk06djk/?context=3) fairly regularly in the rest of this post. So credit to him for these parts.

>The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues. Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights. Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions.

>But unfortunately, this just made the situation worse. The industrialists had no money to do all that, already their businesses were suffering. As a result - Hartals, Lockdowns, Strikes - most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs! (Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres - leading to the very strong grassroots cadre-based politics of West Bengal, still surviving today).

>By the time the government realised their mistake, it was too late. No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest. This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government, which opened up India to foreign investors. These investors came and set shop in other states - who would want to do business in a communist state?

>When Jyoti Basu retired, the new brigade of CPI(M) decided they had to do something to stop the rot. Again, their efforts backfired. They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal - leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests (both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries). Singur agitation ran from late 2005/early 2006, peaking in late 2006 with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case (my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about 20 of us did a sit-in to protest and the first time I was detained by police, in my first year of college!), Nandigram agitation reached it's peak with police firing on protesters on 14th March 2007.

>This outraged all Bengalis. In 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front tally in WB went down from 35 to 15. Then in 2011 Assembly elections, Left Front which had won 233 out of 294 seats in 2006, could manage only 62! In a strange irony, the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists!

So ya, CPM hasnt changed one bit since 2011. The moment they come to power, they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again, ruining farmers again. 
Personally, i hope CPM just dies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Kolkata_firing

>The incident took place on 21 July 1993, when Mamata Banerjee, then state President of Indian Youth Congress, the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal, organised a protest march to Writers' Building, the seat of then communist-led Government of West Bengal. They demanded voter photo-ID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling. However, around 11 AM, one kilometre before the building, they were intervened by the state police, near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade. The police fired at them, resulting in the death of 13 people and several injuries.

She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu.

Her 26 day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important. 

>So, TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM 9 years ago. Unfortunately 9 years is too short a time to right what happened over the past 60 years.

>Has she done everything she could to better Bengal's economy? No, she hasn't. But she has tried. For the first few years it seemed we were going back to 70s and 80s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground. But over the years, her effort has shown. One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance, industries, labour, agriculture, urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians. As a result, economy, civic planning, tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade. The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning, and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy.

>Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people.

>She has also done excellent work for social welfare, especially for girls. Her ""Kanyashree"" project (scholarship to girls from poor families, as long as they are not forcefully married before they are 18, and as long as they attend schools, along with a one time grant of 25000 rupees when the girl turns 18) has done wonders in Bengal. It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go. This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world. People don't talk enough about Kanyashree, it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime.

​

>Is Bengal doing great today? No, not at all. There's still loads of problems that need to be addressed.

>Has her rule been clean and corruption free? Absolutely not!Is Bengal free from political violence? Again, no.Has she done enough? Probably not.

​

>But we are heading towards the right direction, albeit slowly. Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight, there are loads and loads of issues, and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them.

>Overall, I would say she has done more good than harm, which is not something you can say about most governments in India!

NOTE: [Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kanyashree-scheme-for-girls-in-bengal-wins-un-award-1716321)

I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best 2 CM's of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray. Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good.

Also, as seen above, she is THE LEAST EVIL of the 4 choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi. No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right.

As such, i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things.


###PS: What i left out.

https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-makes-bengal-politics-so-different-from-the-rest-of-india/articleshow/68826757.cms?from=mdr 

Its called Syndicate.

In short: After the Partitions, the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally. They decided everything of their local area. This system spread through out the state.

After Bidhan Chandra Ray died, Bangla Congress [then named branch of Bengal INC] basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner. Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually, officially became leaders of their said areas.

Just before CPM came in power in 77, majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called. [NOTE: CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it, which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism]

Same said groups switched sides to TMC in 2011 before they won. And then they came to be known as Syndicate.

Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers.",6

ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,6,fxmvof,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,15,1586440394,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

"Indian govt banning investment from China is yet another ""masterstroke"" by Modi - this time, to kill startups.",0,g4s5yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4s5yd/indian_govt_banning_investment_from_china_is_yet/,13,1587415734,"Modi is on a killing spree. After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 

China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 


After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 



Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 

2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 

3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?


Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the ""ban button"" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi's favourite, for all situations.",6
Here's my side of the story as a small businessman,27,fw7gcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw7gcl/heres_my_side_of_the_story_as_a_small_businessman/,6,1586237386,"This is going to be long. I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.",6
Actuarial student looking for some career advice.,15,fzsng3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzsng3/actuarial_student_looking_for_some_career_advice/,4,1586706844,"Hey there internet people!

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?",6
Oil slump? India will rather play dumb by raising prices,77,fiolca,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fiolca/oil_slump_india_will_rather_play_dumb_by_raising/,23,1584245186,"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-raises-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-by-rs-3-per-litre-2194742?pfrom=home-topstories

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence.",6

So my question is how good is ISBF, Delhi? Apparently, it's affiliated with University of London, with ""academic direction"" from London School of Economics. I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

What do you guys feel? Thanks :D",6

Lives & livelihoods in India,7,fzfkko,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/,1,1586661910,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",6

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.

   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.

As per the new provisions, for .22 LR rifle/pistol 5000 instead of 1000, for another type of Pistol/Revolver 2000 instead of 600 and for shotgun calibers 5000 instead 500 can be purchased by the shooters.
* Apart from this, the Ministry of Home Affairs has also made other necessary amendments in the Arms Rules, 2016 by amending the Arms Act, 1959, vide the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019. Through these amendments, it has also been clarified that no license is required for Indian citizens for acquisitions, possession of small arms falling under the category of curio. However, an appropriate license as prescribed would be required for use or to carry or transport such as small arms. Without the endorsement of such firearms in the prescribed license of the owner, no ammunition shall be sold for their use.
* It may be noted that as per the provisions of the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019, the maximum number of firearms to be possessed by any person has been reduced from three to two. Those in possession of three firearms have been given the facility to retain any two of such firearms and to deposit the remaining firearm by 13.12.2020.

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves.",6
Diwali 2019: Mark My Word Thread (and link to previous predictions),114,dnohi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dnohi0/diwali_2019_mark_my_word_thread_and_link_to/,227,1572177842,"First of all **Happy Diwali Guys**. Keeping up /u/pollguard legacy and /r/India tradition. I present to you Mark My Word Thread of 2019.

**Happy Diwali Guys**

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

Help! How do I stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,117,dwnioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/,43,1573833074,"**Background:**


My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO. 


**TL:DR** Dad burning money in an educational venture. How do I stop this?",6
"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",59,ee6xey,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/,28,1577061630,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

"The impact of GST on invoicing, and thus on revenue and profit of organizations operating in India - exploring one of the factors impacting the economy right now",81,d4mq0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mq0p/the_impact_of_gst_on_invoicing_and_thus_on/,46,1568593682,"tl;dr

Because of GST, organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of GST norms. If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% 

This has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.

My objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.

&#x200B;

Let's start with some basic concepts first:

/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.

But for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)

**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**

&#x200B;

/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.

They are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.

**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**

**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.

**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:

**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -

5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs

Installation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:

a) Delivery of the products & services

b) Invoicing and payment for the order

c) Post-Sale service & maintenance

**Pre-GST Invoicing:**

Before GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.

Manoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.

**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**

If there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.

&#x200B;

**Post-GST Invoicing:**

Like I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.

&#x200B;

The values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:

Maharashtra - 60

UP - 30

Kerala - 10

So in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.

**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**

Since the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.

Manoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***

As you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**

&#x200B;

**The impact from this is:**

**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:

Maharashtra

Chairs - INR 5 Lakhs

Installation - INR 50K

Support - INR 1.5 Lakhs

Kerala

Chairs - INR 3 Lakhs

Installation - INR 30K

Support - INR 90K

UP

Chairs - INR 10 Lakhs

Installation - INR 1 Lakh

Support - INR 3 Lakhs

The total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.

Their efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.

Also like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:

a) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.

b) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.

c) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.

**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.

Thus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.

Because of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.

And the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.

This has two outcomes:

Firstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.

Secondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.

To summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**

**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:

a) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.

b) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.

The biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.

This is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.

**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**

&#x200B;

In conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.

Feel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.

However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth.

Will India embrace blockchain?,2,e8as8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e8as8b/will_india_embrace_blockchain/,2,1575931297,"India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.

The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:

>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.

Besides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project ""Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology."" Blockchain-based ""Proof of Existence (PoE)"" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:

>By using the PoE framework, \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \[proof-of-concept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.

India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.

It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte's research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.

Though India seems to be ""pro-blockchain,"" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:

>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.

Apart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.

1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.
2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.
3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.
4. Crypto is extremely volatile.
5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is ""inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency"", so it cannot replace fiat.

"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office Theory",9,dlf5x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dlf5x8/pakodanomics_olauber_theory_box_office_theory/,4,1571763371,"So when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems. Sadly many of them think it is their fate rather than the failure of governments.",6

Now that they're getting divorced, how can we know if he has put all his money in a bank account we don't know about.

In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,14,czff99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czff99/in_need_of_urgent_advice_regarding_career_please/,3,1567596462,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",6
Mourning the demise (?) of Jet Airways,79,beaonr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/beaonr/mourning_the_demise_of_jet_airways/,36,1555551597,"I am surprised to see absence of Jet Airways closure in my r/india feed.

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

PS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business. Can anyone care to elaborate?",6

> Ahmad then explained privileges puppet candidates like his bring to their sponsors from their entitlements, such as permits for campaign vehicles and additional bank accounts to manipulate spending.

> The election commission has capped expenditure of candidates fighting parliamentary and assembly polls. The limits vary from state to state.

> According to the EC's online handbook for candidates, non-compliance to the ceilings could attract serious action.

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Banerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

Business and boxing: two sides of the same coin,4,cqzusw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqzusw/business_and_boxing_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/,0,1565950400,"By James M. Dorsey



A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, and Patreon, Podbean and Castbox.



What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

With the National Clean Energy FUnd now be used to compensate States for the losses due to GST, what is the Govt's plan to fund its environment and climate actions now?

Why regulations around sale and use of pet coke have been relaxed?

 
What is the status of the Waste Segregation and City Compost Policy under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which were supposed to be taken up in 2017?


Sustainable solutions for agriculture, waste management, pollution ++ do not cost much. Why can’t the bureaucracy look at such solutions?


Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years?




FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.
Unquote


You ride on seaplane during Gujarat election, didn't left enough water for irrigation in Narmada dam. Why?
Today coastal Saurashtra is in submerged condition, forget about sea plane there isn't enough life savings boat, how can you afford seaplane?


Agreed the sardar sarovar dam is finished, But when will you actually complete the entire project? More than 50,000km of sub canal work is pending!


What is the status of the new crop insurance scheme? How much premiums were paid and what is the payout to farmers?


How many marginal farmers who were not earlier given loans by institutional finance been brought into institutional finance instead of loan sharks



FINANCE



Who IS the FM? 


Why the hell is Aadhaar, which was initially implemented for granting govt benefits directly to the people being used as an identity card now and being forced to link with banks and mobile numbers (Even when proved that it is not unique nor safely guarded)?

What was the actual purpose of demonetisation ? Did it yield any results? How much effective was it in combating counterfeit currency and curbing terrorism? Why does RBI takes so much time to count all the notes?
Why petrol not included in the GST?


Why Alcohol not included in the GST?


How this government understand the final effect/result of any project they rollout.(e.g Jan Dhan/ Ganga /Demonetization / etc)


Do they really care about ground reality, if yes then please tell the procedure? 


Do they have any deadline to get the feedback / Complete the process.



EDUCATION



Why was autonomous status forced down on Universities?


Do you have a good word or not on the changes brought about in Delhi schools by a different govt?


The commitment to IoE has come down from 20000cr to just 3000cr. Why?


Why is there an urgency to bring in the No Detention policy, without setting up a proper lower education infrastructure where the teachers are asked not only to teach but sent on census duty and election duty etc?'


Why is only 3% of the budget being concentrated on the education? Why haven't you shared the cess collected in the development of the schools? 


Research fellows from IIT will be paid Rs. 70000 as stipend. Why not extend this from other institutions too? For instance, JRFs are given Rs. 25k, SRF’s Rs. 28k and RA’s Rs. 35k-40k


How difficult is it to disburse Central government fellowships to research students on time? Even with the DBT scheme in place, why are research students not receiving fellowship money for 10 months?


What about Jio University? Which factors indicated it to be ranked as an eminent institute?


JOBS



If the Hon PM is so concerned about the lack of data on jobs, then why was the annual labour survey of employment -unemployment discontinued on his watch after 2016?


Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues. But state govts and municipalities continue their nexus with contractors who charge astronomical sums for waste-handling equipment and for transportation of waste. Why is a well-intended mission being defeated by the (lower) bureaucracy? Civic action groups must be involved.


New pension scheme: Is it a good idea to link pensions to the stock market?

How are the retrospective amendments to FCRA wrt political contributions tenable?


What is the sense behind having a non-transparent electoral bond mechanism for donating to Political parties?


Why did you allow the secrecy in election bond ? And by keeping it known to bank govt have direct control on data.




ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY



See for example the ""National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business"". http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/DraftNationalGuidelines2018_20062018.pdf


Question: Do the #NVGs (National Voluntary Guidelines) apply to banks? And the Government itself? Our govts are unable to ensure compliance to mandatory laws. How will the #NVGs work out?


The PM speaks of combating corruption, Then why the electoral bonds and Removing provisions of RTI, which kills the transparency all the more?

Where is the data on demonetization and its effects (both positive and negative)?


Why did gov legalise foreign funding of political parties? That too retrospectively?


Why isnt any serious action taken on Panama Papers, where a country like pakistan can send their ex pm to jail for it?




Q) Does Modi and people in his party think all people are idiots? Serious Question since they keep on barking on without facts or figures and just talks as the teenage me fighting against my parents talking random shit that doesn’t matter in the context.


--There are still a lot of people who still support modi even after seeing the evidences. They are mostly carried by the Hindutva narrative.( And these are educated people working in very big MNCs, living in metro cities)


Modi should answer the priority his government has given to basic education in government schools, employment opportunities and healthcare facilities?


Can the government please explain why the states have not been given a part of the 2.35 lac crores collected in the form of cess in 2016-17?


Environment is suffering , what is the take of Modi government to tackle pollution and save natural resources(water, forests)?

LAW AND ORDER



Silence on the damage to social fabric (includes Mob Lynching).


 What are the measures taken by the govt for overall protection of women in the society in the wake of recent spike in rapes?


Why arent police being recruited in full force? There are vacancies in large numbers in almost every state? 


Does the govt care about the people being lynched willy nilly by people taking law into their own hands or do they think it's not the govt responsibility to ensure the safety and security of its citizens?


Why hasn’t the Central government passed the Women’s reservation bill in Lok Sabha which is due from 2008 after being passed in Rajya Sabha?


Who handles PM’s social media accounts? If it's done by PMO, what steps have been taken to avoid encouraging anti social elements on SM, especially given the fact that PM’s twitter account follows people found giving online rape threats and abuses to women/journalists/ministers.


Why did the bjp take a 4 long years to decide n use the “nirbhaya funds” on women safety issues? Doesn't this blatantly show how much the gov is serious n care for women safety?? Especially girls r subjected to violence every second in the co (Nirbhaya funds were alloted after the gruesome delhi rape case.)


What’s the current status on the Uniform Civil Code?



FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?


Why does the gov not allocating enough budget for health care despite india ranking low in HDI even with our neighbours countries ?




OTHER



Is it unparliamentary to hug someone in parliament as suggested by Bhupendra Chaubey?


Why are ministers with unscientific viewpoint still given cabinet portfolios?


Why does government not invest in Cyber Security like other major countries like China, Russia and USA? Our government websites and databases are not fully secured (as evident from data being accessed by fs0ciety from AP govt. website) We have great Security Engineers, but they are all employed in Private Sector.


Why was AAP asked to repay the amount they spent from government treasury on advertisement, but BJP keeps plastering Modi’s photo everyday in the newspapers and online advertisement (nearly Rs 4600 crores) without any repercussions?

M21, Delhi

&#x200B;

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

&#x200B;

\[EDIT\]   do i need to register  or do anything under shop and establishment act? 

&#x200B;

do i need a manufacturers licence ?",6

Broke up 30! What next???,15,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,1548813778,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

Is it possible to switch careers at 24? Please help.,8,besg9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/besg9q/is_it_possible_to_switch_careers_at_24_please_help/,3,1555659655,"I started working in a loose diamonds family business at 22. Worked only for a year and switched to a jewelry factory because it was difficult to work with my dad. 

I am 24 and still at the jewelry factory. The timings are tough - 9 am to 7 pm Mon-Fri. 9 am to 3 pm on Saturdays. I get paid only 55k. But most importantly, this is a dead end job. There is a stagnation in learning and earning after a few years. My manager with an experience of 18 years earns only 130k a month.

I am planning to self-teach web development. I do not come from a technical background. I did my undergrad in BBA in Finance. 

Is it possible to switch careers at this age? Is it possible to get jobs in Singapore, Hong Kong or other countries as a self-taught web developer?

Another option is to keep doing this job while freelance as a web developer. Is this possible?",6
"Due to family problems, I had to forego my college education. Now I may have the option to finally do something about that. Please advice me on how to proceed? [Long]",35,9pj0at,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9pj0at/due_to_family_problems_i_had_to_forego_my_college/,19,1539977979,"Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",6

"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.",27,9ypjsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ypjsr/so_you_made_yourself_a_little_bit_of_money_huh/,11,1542724145,"# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

The Kerala Model,137,79u1il,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/79u1il/the_kerala_model/,159,1509460867,"Let's have an objective discussion of the merits & sustainability of the Kerala model. Please don't downvote if you merely disagree. 



1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.  [Source](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/not-rank-state-wants-kerala-high-unemployment-we-need-more-entrepreneurs-govt-says-61216)



3. Political Violence and the most fertile ground for ISIS recruitment in India. [Kerala tops the crime rate list, with 16.3 riot cases per lakh people, followed by Bihar (12.9) and Karnataka (10.6).](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/327-rise-in-agrarian-riots-in-2015-NCRB-report-shows/article14598321.ece) [How Isis recruiters found fertile ground in Kerala, India's tourist gem.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/isis-recruiters-fertile-ground-kerala-indias-tourist-gem)



4. Second last in Ease of Doing Business Ranking amongst the general category (removing the somewhat isolated NE states, troubled J&K and small Union Territories besides Delhi) and 20th rank across India. [Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period. [Source](http://indien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_indien/Bilder/2015_News_and_Info/economic_news/collab_-fdi_into_india.pdf)




6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state. (That's cool, I have no issues with alcohol.)



7. Dire position of the State Finances: [Five charts that explain the crisis in Kerala’s economy.](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/HkujNa0LphyCVSoqFFIEWK/Five-charts-that-explain-the-crisis-in-the-Kerala-economy.html) They even exceeded the Fiscal Deficit Targets which they had committed too.







2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth — Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 — of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014. 



____



I like this summary: **“Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,”** said S. Irudaya Rajan, a demographer at the Center for Development Studies, a local research group. “There would have been starvation deaths in Kerala if there had been no migration. The Kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world, including Kerala.” [Source: NYTimes- Jobs Abroad Support ‘Model’ State in India.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/world/asia/07migrate.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1) It's a pretty good read.

Does anyone use Justdial?,9,bkceku,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bkceku/does_anyone_use_justdial/,2,1556940344,"Guys. I'm sitting in a movie theatre looking at back to back Justdial ads featuring Amitabh Bachhan and  thinking, does anyone use JD these days?

I've always seen my friends and colleagues use Google to find businesses (especially with geolocation), and Urbanclap for booking services. Apart from that there are the standard food delivery and ticket booking apps like Swiggy and PayTm.

Yes, it's a pain to use multiple apps, something JD is promising to solve. But I've never seen anyone use JD regularly. Yes, I've also logged in once, maybe a few years ago and found it severely lacking in comparison to google, and left it.

Next comes the part about Financing. I think that JD is charging businesses to list themselves, but why would anyone pay? The app has a very small user base I recon. So how do they run their operations? Do they have any other mode of revenue, even from other businesses that I'm not aware about?",6
Some Gyan for aspiring MBA students about which no one will bother to talk,62,84vvjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/84vvjc/some_gyan_for_aspiring_mba_students_about_which/,81,1521239786,"I am 2013 MBA pass out. 

I am surprised to see so much misplaced expectations and ignorance among MBA aspirants.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR. 

It makes sense to opt this from job perspective.",6
"Law graduates of r/India, My close friend (cancer survivor), plans to do LLB this year. He is 36 years old. Is there any merit to his decision ?",72,86kq7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86kq7c/law_graduates_of_rindia_my_close_friend_cancer/,67,1521841563,"Hi,

A big thank you to all good Samaritans of r/India for their advice and feedback.

My friend has given me access to this reddit account after seeing the response.

I experienced outright rejection during my recent MBA entry level job interviews due to my situation.

I was depressed, angry and confused about my future.

I was very skeptical if r/India could really help me out with my situation.

But all your feedback and suggestions, have given me a new hope.

**Original Post by my friend:**

Law graduates of r/India, Please share your views on this :

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age.",6
Is it worth moving to Canada on the basis of job opportunity at the age of 50 as an Indian Male???,20,9w2du8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9w2du8/is_it_worth_moving_to_canada_on_the_basis_of_job/,11,1541955209,"I have been holding a license from IRDA, government of India as approved insurance surveyor (for collision of Automobiles) & valuator since 1990.

"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",7,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,1552304367,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,548,6s4hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s4hoh/tldr_godman_to_tycoon_the_untold_story_of_baba/,95,1502127309,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Edit 1: Formatting

Edit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. That will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc. ",6

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love.

We really need to talk about Flairs.,110,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].

[RANT] SBI worker blames me for faulty transactions even though plenty of their customers are getting scammed,53,7yvec1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yvec1/rant_sbi_worker_blames_me_for_faulty_transactions/,59,1519157180,"I received a message today about being credited with some 12k on my SBI account which confused me. Checked my online SBI account and realised that a week back some Google Octro had made a transaction of that 12k from my account which I had not realised. A simple google search showed that a lot of SBI customers were also complaining about this Google Octro thing (also found a TOI article on it). Its an App on the Google Play store from what I understood. But never mind that, I was just thankful I got my money back. However, a quick advice from my father was to close my SBI account because the Octro company may still have my account details and such, so there might be a risk of such fraudulent or faulty or whatever transactions to occur again. I've never taken the time to manage my finances or understand how fraud transactions work so this part is probably my fault because I realised a week late that 12k was even missing from my account in the first place. So I went to the bank to close my account and maybe create a new account after that.

Now I am not confrontational, and I even see my faults in the whole thing. But the man behind the desk was a whole different story. When I went and old him I'd like to close my account, he looked up the statement of my transactions. And I pointed out the faulty ones and he started blaming me for those.

He used a shitty ass analogy and I quote ""if a pick pocket steals from a person and the person doesn't realise then the blame lies on the person for not realising."" Yea right the pickpocket is the angel here for stealing from a man carrying a wallet. What the fuck is this victim blaming nonsense?? 

He told me I can't blame the bank for not realising I lost money. Except I didn't even blame the bank. I only told him I wanted to close my account and gave him the reason when he asked why??

And then I told him I have been busy with things plus my card was with my parents too during that time so I didn't properly check my account frequently and I realise that its my fault. And then he was like ""of course its your fault. Computer won't make mistakes it'll only do what its told, so if there was a mistake in telling it what to do then you should've realised and complained."" 

And then the icing on the cake was that he went on ""You youngsters are on the phone the whole day doing WhatsApp yet you didn't check the transaction message. I know you people are always looking at your phone and message toh aaya hi hoga. Tumhi ne nahi dekha."" All this after I explained that I know it was my fault that I didn't realise.

Why are office workers in India so rude? This may seem like a small thing for many of you but I hate confrontation and avoid it as much as possible. I even admitted the blame on my part and I didn't even lodge a complaint or anything but they still decide to aggressively blame and mock me for being irresponsible? lol and SBI is definitely not at all at fault even though plenty of their customers had actually suffered cause of this Google Octro fiasco.

My experience with SBI so far had been pretty decent until this incident. But now I'm just going to go ahead and get my account closed and move to another bank.

tl:dr SBI account had fraudulent transaction, got blamed for being irresponsible",6

India and its States: some states are too much populated to govern efficiently,7,9zgjc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9zgjc8/india_and_its_states_some_states_are_too_much/,4,1542939833,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.

No Progress on the Panama Papers! Despite over 1800 Indian Names Disclosed!,253,63lhl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63lhl9/no_progress_on_the_panama_papers_despite_over/,77,1491427486,"NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS. OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED.

""The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn’t working–because globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama’s of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

"Debunked: ""Do the maths: India's first bullet train isn't 'free of cost' as Modi claims"" - lazy journalist",97,717dlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/717dlb/debunked_do_the_maths_indias_first_bullet_train/,45,1505895784,"The article in question: http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/do-the-math-india-s-first-bullet-train-isn-t-free-of-cost-as-modi-claims-117091800116_1.html

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

Indian banking system under attack!,173,589exo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/589exo/indian_banking_system_under_attack/,84,1476898470,"I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

#But wait... the Bill says 'Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services'. How are they allowed to do these *other* things?
___

There has been a lot of debate for years about the Aadhaar card. On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. 

But alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [""Take out the Trash"" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.

*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*

**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**

Aye. That can be done. 

There is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled ""Power of Authority to make Regulations"" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.

[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)

[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)


Look at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:

- [Biometric Information](http://imgur.com/i4lD5oS)

- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)

- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)

- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)

All of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does ""other purposes"" even mean?!

I have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.

But... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?

#What can we do about it now?
___
Well, nothing, I’m afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  

Unless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act’s validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it’s an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can’t do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. 

If the SC *does* strike the Act down, I’m afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.


I will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody:

Our Banks are in trouble & we need to talk about it,422,47ogw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47ogw5/our_banks_are_in_trouble_we_need_to_talk_about_it/,93,1456511511,"Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. 

Here, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.

**What are NPAs and why should we care?**

Loans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. 

The NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. 

On top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. 

**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** 

Simply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, ""Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help."" 

**What will the Government do about this?**

One word: Bailout. 
This whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. 

**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**

No. 

Here's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:

1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) 

2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)

3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)

5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)

The revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? 

(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)

**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**

This problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! 

1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*

The banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.

A Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). 

&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, ""People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks… it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?”

They asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:

&gt; “The required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.""

Personally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? 

*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*

If anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.

*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*

If this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. 

Modi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.

*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*

Aah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. 

Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. 

*5) Big Corporates*

The usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...

Some projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) 

**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**

To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

EDIT: Forgot to add one more thing.

Indian Express reported the NPA problem first on [February 9, 2016](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-1140000000000-bad-debts-the-great-govt-bank-write-off/).

Last Week in the Indian Parliament #2 (May 02 to May 06),369,4it1ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4it1ef/last_week_in_the_indian_parliament_2_may_02_to/,68,1462965769,"Hello /r/India!

I bring you the second edition of Last Week in the Indian Parliament! I got a lot of feedback last time and people insisted I keep it more narrative based. I shall do so but I have also included briefs from PRS in the end for the legislative business transacted during the week. 

Boy do I have stories for you today!

Last week, a Rajya Sabha member was suspended for a day for making ‘unauthorised inane noise’; a controversial amendment was passed which allows foreign funding for political parties; the government of the day tactfully avoided being embarrassed by a new ‘Jumla’; and Big Tobacco fought the Government with Zero Hour Notices.

Let’s get right into it!

___
#Money Bill strikes again!
___
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker’s grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!


The first instance of ‘Operation Money Bill’ was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.

And this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!

The Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).

___
#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players
___

The FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). 

The logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.

This amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‘Operation Money Bill’) and the President’s approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.

___
#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016
___
During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. 

The decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.

**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**

While giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. 

Still no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.

[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)

The Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.

[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)

After the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi’s point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.

[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)

Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha. 

The Finance Minister be like [#EpicWin](http://img.memecdn.com/epic-win_o_834502.gif).

___
#The ‘Jumla’ that escaped
___
Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) issue in Rajya Sabha. Jairam Ramesh has written about this extensively in The Hindu ( [Part 1](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jairam-ramesh-on-the-krishna-godavari-basin-scam/article8486493.ece) & [Part 2](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-by-jairam-ramesh-on-the-kg-basin-scam-part-ii/article8533360.ece) ). 
To give you a short rundown of this ‘Jumla’, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.

But then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.

Jaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating. 

___
#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter
___
Rajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. 

> “The Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.” [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)

Hamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. 

Here’s an excerpt from the debate:

[""Please stop making inane noise""](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)

[""Please stop talking... or else""](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)

[""RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!""](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)

After the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‘unauthorized inane noise’ with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them. Ansari pointed out that Rule 255 applies only to individual members and cannot be enforced en masse.

[Obama... I mean... Ansari out!](http://giphy.com/gifs/obama-mic-drop-out-3o7qDLkrKr034Z3hQI)

#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures
___
There have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government’s move.

Last week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government’s move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. 

On 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government’s move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.

Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government’s 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.

**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**

‘Zero Hour’ refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It’s upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.

The Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.

###Headline Stories

**The Good News: Inflation**

Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of retail stores in India reducing their prices to a 3 month low. After rising for five straight months, retail inflation in February came down to 5.18%. This has been [attributed](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-14/news/71509641_1_retail-inflation-price-rise-pulses) largely to a fall in the prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits. While cereal prices remained the same, the dark lining is that prices of eggs shot up significantly. Time to substitute omelets with salads, perhaps? But that’s just the retail end of business. Coming to the wholesale side of business, inflation in wholesale prices fell for the 16th straight month and remained [negative](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Decline-in-inflation-on-expected-line-Finanace-ministry/articleshow/51400780.cms) at -0.91%. The data comes from the Consumer and Wholesale Price Indices, which track retail and wholesale prices around the country.


**The Bad News: Foreign Trade**

Not to harsh your mellow, but stop rejoicing over the good news for a second and hear this. India’s February Exports decreased by 5.66%. If you haven’t been following the export numbers, and no one can blame you for that, this is the 15th consecutive month in which exports have [decreased](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rfZrfTFsUFMVWkTXV8wEAK/Indias-February-trade-deficit-narrows-to-65-billion.html). Petroleum products was the dark swan as exports of gasoline, jet fuel etc. fell by 28%. The golden goose of the bunch was jewellery as exports of shiny rings and necklaces increased by 11%. Just to give you some perspective, our brothers to the north, the Chinese saw their exports fall by 25%. On the flip side, India’s imports also decreased by 5.03%. You win some, you lose some, right? 


**Rajya Sabha Feels Betrayed**

Giving statutory backing to the unique identity number system, the Lok Sabha this week has passed the [Aadhaar Bill](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-aadhaar-bill/article8361467.ece?homepage=true). This newly passed bill is a significant instrument for the government’s Direct Transfer Benefits scheme for better targeting of subsidies. The argument against it was that it violated the Supreme Court order that said an Aadhaar Card cannot be mandatory but only voluntary. Now, if you remember your 7th standard civics syllabus, both houses of the parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, have to pass a bill for it to become a law. What your 7th standard civics textbook probably didn’t mention is the Rajya Sabha has no say in the matter if a specific bill is categorized as a “money bill”. Which is exactly what Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who piloted the Aadhaar bill through parliament, did so that it can bypass the Rajya Sabha where Jaitley’s BJP does not have a majority. One can only imagine how emotionally hurt the Rajya Sabha was when the Lok Sabha went behind its back to pass the Aadhaar Bill. 

**It’s Raining Black Gold: Sweet, Sweet Oil**

“Tass-Yurikah” sounds like an Urdu swear word, but it’s actually the name of a Russian oil field. Soon enough, it won’t even be entirely Russian anymore. A group of Indian oil companies signed a deal with Rosneft, the Russian oil company that owns [Tass-Yurikah](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-videsh-ltd-ioc-consortium-to-buy-russian-oil-fields-for-4-2-billion/articleshow/51427860.cms), to buy a 29.9% stake in the oilfield for $1.28 billion (₹8,505 crore). This puts the Indians in partnership with the British oil major BP who owns 20% while the remaining 50.1% is still owned by Rosneft. Deals to explore a possible stake sale in Vankor, another Russian oilfield, were also signed. This comes at a time when global oil prices are falling off a cliff, just like BJP’s poll numbers in that [recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_2015) Bihar election. This also comes at a time when Russia’s economy is suffering from an acute case of international sanctions that were imposed on Russia after they snatched Crimea from Ukraine, just like the JD(U) snatched seats from BJP in that recent Bihar election. Too political? Thought so. Meanwhile, they just [hiked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-petrol-price-hiked-by-rs-3-07-litre-diesel-by-rs-1-90-litre-1287407) petrol and diesel prices by 3.07/litre and 1.07/litre.

**Ban on 344 Illegal Drugs**

The government is playing the game that everyone knows it excels at - banning things. This time around, the health ministry has issued a ban on over [344 drugs](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/health-ministry-bans-344-fixed-dose-combination-drugs-1286977). No, not the one’s that make you hallucinate or see sounds and hear colours, but the one’s that are pharmaceutical. Known as “combination drugs”, these drugs combine two or more drugs together so the patient only has to pop one pill instead of three. Technically, they were being sold illegally since none of them had approval from the central government, but had entered markets nevertheless after receiving blessings from only the state governments. At least this time around, the bans make more sense. Cough syrup Corex and the famous Vicks Action 500 were among the 344 substances banned. However, the Delhi High Court reversed the ban on [Corex](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-corex-popular-cough-syrup-not-banned-for-now-says-court-1287076?ndtv_related) and is set to hear the case on March 21st after Pfizer ([PFIZER](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APFIZER&ei=uk_vVqjdIoSVjAGihJ_IBw)), the company that makes Corex, sent lawyers marching down to the Court right away. Feeling a bit jealous of Pfizer, 21 other pharmaceutical companies, including P&G India ([PGHH](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APGHH&ei=tk_vVsGTOJPwjAGTuZQg)), the maker of [Vicks](http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hc-relief-for-14-more-drug-firms/210246.html), also managed to convince the court to reverse bans placed on their drugs as well.

**Make Room for One More Tax**

You know how countries sometimes impose tariffs on foreign goods to make domestic players competitive? Well, states across India such as Uttarakhand, Bihar and Assam seem to have forgotten that they are not independent countries but merely states within one. It’s okay, we all go through an identity crisis at some point. Lawmakers in those states have imposed an “[entry tax](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-15/news/71543125_1_entry-tax-goods-services-tax-levy)” on e-commerce websites for selling products that were not made in those states - which sounds eerily similar to tariffs imposed by sovereign nations. What could make this worse? Almost half a dozen other states are also considering imposing a similar tax on e-commerce goods sold inside the state that were manufactured outside the state. If this goes through, you might have to foot the bill for your state’s poor manufacturing as online retailers pass these taxes on to the customer. Also, the grapevine has it that Amazon offered to acquire Flipkart for [$8 billion](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Flipkart-and-Amazon-may-have-explored-sale-talks-say-sources/articleshow/51421374.cms) (₹53,160 crore) last year, but the deal fell through. Make of that what you will.

Stay in an excellent job vs come back to live with my family?,36,65nu2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/65nu2c/stay_in_an_excellent_job_vs_come_back_to_live/,47,1492352581,"I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).

Background:

A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.

I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.

I have two options to choose from:

**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**

I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.

My one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.

Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.

In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.

Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.

While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. 
 
**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**

I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",6

**27 Banks today = 6 Banks Tomorrow**

Strength in unity is the chant on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s mind as a new expert committee was set up to explore possible [bank mergers](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-may-form-6-stong-banks-from-merger-of-27-psbs-to-tackle-rising-bad-loan-issue-2186336) to bring down the number of state-run banks in India from 27 today to just 6 in the future. And with the bad loans crisis looming over the banking industry, strength is just what the doctor prescribed. Apparently, since public sector banks are already short-staffed, bank employees don’t have to worry about downsizing in case any of these mergers actually happen. Words of caution, however: Too big to fail?

**IIP: Third Time’s (not) the Charm**

For the third month in a row, [industrial production](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/G1Hs0uma1LuBdMLkYpQlFL/Indias-IIP-contracts-15-in-January-third-month-in-a-row.html) in India went down. The numbers for the month of January released just recently by the Central Statistical Organization don’t look good - a 1.5% drop in industrial production, that’s against a 1.2% drop in December and a 3.2% drop in November. That is bad with a capital B. Silver lining on the cloud that’s raining on everyone’s parade? Mining and Electricity sectors grew by 1.2% and 6.6% in January respectively. Raghuram Rajan, the main god that economists around the country worship who also moonlights as the Governor of RBI, has called the numbers “disappointing” while stating that though the economy is in recovery, the process is volatile.

**Housing For All by 2022**

So you thought Swachh Bharat was Prime Minister Modi’s only pet project? Then you haven’t heard about the Housing For All initiative under which the PM aims to provide homes for all Indian families by 2022. The country inched a step closer to that goal when the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament, passed a landmark bill seeking to regulate the [Real Estate](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-realestate-regulations-parliament-idINKCN0WC1DJ) sector to bring more transparency and protect consumer interests. And this bill.. get this, was passed by bipartisan support as even the Congress came out of the woodwork to extend its support. Now when was the last time you heard about the ruling and the opposition party coming together and working to pass important legislation? Almost makes you wonder if they are.. [up to something](https://j.gifs.com/v29nEn.gif).

**Not Happening: EPF Tax**

The government has suddenly become very sensitive to any kind of backlash as was apparent when Arun Jaitley announced that a key budget proposal to tax withdrawals from EPF exceeding 40% of total investment would be rolled back. The proposal led to controversy among the small but vocal professional class who viewed it as a tax on the hard-working middle-class employees, and thus was promptly [shot down](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-pensions-epf-tax-withdraw-jaitley-idINKCN0WB0BE). Might it have anything to do with the not one, not two, not three, but five states holding elections in April and May? With politics, you can be sure that the elections have a big role in.. really everything that politicians do or don’t do. 

**Vijay Mallya Just Can’t Win**

It’s hard to empathize with the problems of rich billionaires, but poor Mallya just can’t seem to catch a break. A debt recovery tribunal in Bengaluru has [cash blocked](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-barred-from-accessing-rs-515-crore-severance-pay-1284719) Vijay Mallya by halting the $75 million (₹515 crore) payment he was set to receive as settlement from Diageo plc., the largest shareholder in Mallya’s United Spirits Ltd. ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=yRjmVsGsBsWd2Aas8ovwBg)). Later, a bunch of banks ganged up on him as they seized [trademarks](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-mallya-idUSKCN0WC184) related to the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines, trademarks such as “Kingfisher”, “Flying Models” and “King of Good Times”. And then came the accusations that Mallya has fled the country, which led to the banks asking a court to return and impound his passport. Moral of the story: Kids, never borrow $1.4 billion to run a flashy airliner when you can’t repay it. Especially when you already own a successful liquor company.

**Ambani vs. Netflix**

Mukesh Ambani has decided that there is no way Netflix can just waltz into India and lay claim to his homeground without facing any competition. Not one to keep his hands off any pie, he is reportedly entering the country’s cable TV sector through his latest venture called RJio. Ambani’s Reliance Industries ([RELIANCE](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ARELIANCE&ei=DBnmVsG4Atf3jAHklKf4DA)) which already owns TV channels like CNBC, Colors, ETV and many more is planning to spend about $2 billion (₹13,403 crore) over the next three years to capture 20 million TV subscribers. One of the offerings in store from RJio is [Jio Play](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-reliance-cable-tv-idUSKCN0W92J4), a movie and TV series streaming service, in short, it’s version of Netflix. India being a massive entertainment market, Netflix probably isn’t going to watch this from the sidelines. Grab the popcorn, this movie just might get interesting.

What does r/India think of Bitcoin? India must act now or miss out on this emerging technology.,41,6f3v9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6f3v9z/what_does_rindia_think_of_bitcoin_india_must_act/,29,1496556903,"Bitcoin currently has grown so much in size that its market cap is bigger than any of USA's top airlines. Yes, these are Airlines like Delta with hundred's and hundreds of Boeing airplanes in their fleet connecting every city of America yet a simple technology run on a computer has usurped all these airlines. No mean feat. 

Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. 

Meanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with ""chit funds"" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. 

And Im not talking about middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. 

We are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.


Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin. Many businesses are already hedging their funds vs BTC or investing part of their profits into BTC and the growth of 2500% since 2015 will only make more companies turn to BTC. 

Im sure many smart Indians have already started to see the potential of BTC, lets use this thread to discuss the market in India. ",6

"[NP] Businesspeople of r/india, need your advise.",10,3okalt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3okalt/np_businesspeople_of_rindia_need_your_advise/,10,1444754634,"Hi good people of r/india. I'm 31 and in a pretty heavy mess. I started a logistics b2b business in late 2012 after being in a first generation family run business (logistics too) since 2007. The industry has cut-throat competition and is also very unorganised and unregulated (anyone with a PAN card and an address can start) ; which is also probably the reason I could start mine (I barely had any other licenses, market knowledge or professional business management experience). I had some working capital to begin with (~Rs. 20L) and I burnt through the cash within a few months while trying to fiercely enter the market by selling below or at cost. Other than underquoting, selling at cost or absorbing the operational losses to safeguard the customer, I really didn't use the money at hand for any meaningful long term capital expenditure like systems, inventories, warehouses, staff etc. So once I ran out of cash (and this happened in mid-2013) I had absolutely no leverage to retain the hard-earned (and costly) customers and I started losing them. So though there was some decent turnover through all that cash burn, the bottom lines were all naturally red.

All this put me under tremendous stress. Under stress instead of approaching the banks for fresh funds, I approached private lenders for instant small funds to clear off the immediate debts to the vendors. These borrowings were obviously super costly but I ignored them so as not to antagonise the vendors. But the private lenders had a very small kitty compared to my requirements and suddenly I was left having to pay off the lenders as well as the vendors! 

In between all this, although I had asked my family to give me some time to settle down and tried making them understand the mess I was in, they barely understood anything and pressurised me into getting married. It was an arranged marriage. I do not want to blame my family anymore than this about the marriage because I am blessed with a very supportive and understanding wife. So I married in mid 2014. That happened and within 8-9 months, we decided (yet again against my full approval) to buy a freaking house. On one hand my business was bleeding cash so much that there was no blood left to even bleed and on the other I was shopping for houses - because my family (this time my wife and in-laws included!) absolutely wanted us to own a house of our own. Won't blame my wife because it was barely an year into the marriage and I hadn't told her the full extent of the issues as I didn't want to scare or stress her, so she and my in-laws were obviously not fully aware of the facts. 

Now, most of my family (excluding the wife and in-laws, once they realised they may have pressurised into buying the house they do not want to put any more undue pressure) are telling me to find a job to relieve part of the stress and I am willing too to look for a job. But I'm neck deep in liabilities and I just don't know how I can simply shut shop one day and just go looking for a job without fulfilling all my current liabilities.

All this might sound like a template for the perfect financial & business mismanagement, but here I am stressed as stressed can be and I really could use some advise. ",6

Busy researching and taking all of your responses into account. A million thanks! <3

Hey, lovely people of Reddit!

Travelling India has been one of my lifelong dreams, and I finally find myself in a place where I'm able to begin saving up to make that dream a reality! I now come before you beautiful folk to seek advice in forming an itinerary.

Some details:

-I'm looking to stay anywhere from 3 months to a year, depending on finances. 

-I hope to find ways to meaningfully immerse in each place I visit (through volunteer positions, homestays, etc) and am definitely not looking to rush from one city to the next.

-I am especially interested in rural, natural areas which provide possibilities for trekking and other outdoor adventures. I am not at all interested in touristy, expat party bubbles.

-I'm excited by food (who isn't?), literature, history, music, yoga and Ayurvedic health practices.

I know these are fairly vague constraints but I'm overwhelmed by the vastness of the country and its multiplicities and would very much appreciate any pointers as to where to begin my travel research!

I plan on doing most of my exploring as a solo female traveler, so would also appreciate any advice to that end. 

A million thanks in advance!!

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

Should I get an MBA? [NP],5,3ewrql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ewrql/should_i_get_an_mba_np/,9,1438126970,"Currently, I am a undergrad student majoring in Finance in Thailand. I will be done in December. I haven’t done 10+2 –> only did the IGCSEs. My dad runs a jewellery business which I will join if I do not go for Masters. I have no prior knowledge about the business and I will move to India to train myself (it has been taken care of).

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else’s guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass). But this would also mean boycotting the MBA.

Also, maybe pursue a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) course at some point – although unlikely.

How do you think of my plan? Will it be wise to not pursue MBA? I am uncertain if this is the right way to go and would love to have opinions. ",6

Any income of a political party which is chargeable under the head ""Income from house property"" or ""Income from other sources"" or ""Capital gains"" or any income by way of voluntary contributions received by a political party from any person shall not be included in the total income of the previous year of such political party :

I'm fairly certain that the level of mathematics is that of 6th - 10th grades.


[This article](http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1952) seems to make more sense.


Moreover, NRIs who take admission in Indian engineering colleges receive the shock of their lives when they see that their fellow batchmates are already quite familiar with concepts of calculus that the SAT does not test at all. As a result, many of these students end up failing math in their first semester and might even begin a downward spiral due to depression.


Every year I keep hearing talks of IIMs wanting to be more like foreign b-schools where majority of the batch does not hail from an engineering background, but from commerce/business backgrounds. But it's not just about MBA programs. Even the batch profile of the Msc Finance program at JBIMS reveals that out of the 30 students it takes in, majority have engineering background.


I appeared for the interview at JBIMS. I'm a BBA - Finance grad and was asked what subjects I studied in BBA. I told them the subjects (Management accounting, strategic financial managemnt, etc.) and they countered asking, ""If you have already studied these subjects in graduation, why do you want to study them again in post grad?"". And here I thought that it would make more sense for business and commerce grads to pursue an MFin because that is much more coherent than jumping over to MFin from engineering.

5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard ?,28,6cfxc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6cfxc8/5_reasons_why_layoff_in_india_can_be_especially/,21,1495392186,"""Top 5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard"" 

Do you agree? 

1. Social stigma: The middle-class in India attaches a lot of ‘status’ to what one does for a living. Among the first questions one gets asked during introductions include “where do you work?” (or “Where does your husband work?”). “He used to work for Infosys and just got laid-off” doesn’t cut it.  

2. Identity and self-worth: Typical middle-class kids are conditioned to work hard to succeed. When one is laid-off due to factors beyond one’s control (‘business reasons’) one begins to question one’s basic values. 

3. Pressure from relatives: Those from an earlier generation – parents, uncles and relatives of IT workers – equate ‘layoff’ to ‘firing.’ Right after layoff, they may begin to gossip “Ramesh was fired by Wipro. I though he was doing well there. What did he do wrong?” 

4. Financial challenges : Many IT workers over-leveraged their finances by “Investing” in expensive, upscale apartments, houses, cars and white-goods with large EMIs and credit card payments. Sudden stoppage of a paycheck can certainly be hard. 

5. Other practical challenges:  Many of those who are being laid-off are single and in their twenties and early thirties. Until recently, an ‘IT groom’ with a nice paycheck was a prime-catch in the matrimonial market. All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

Hello /r/India,

In this edition of Last Week in Indian Parliament, we talk about the great ‘Pillar Fight’; quorum of the house and the absence of it; and how Rajya Sabha turned into a nukkad Ganpati Utsav culture day. 

I also wanted to write about: ""The Enforcement of Security Interest and (*takes a deep breath*) Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (AMENDMENT) Bill, 2016 to amend the Securitisation and (*takes another deep breath*) Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 a.k.a the SARFAESI Act""

But then I realized it requires a whole new post.

So let's get right into it!

___

#“Hon’ble Members…”

#“Absent, Madam.”
___

The Budget session adjourned sine-dine on Friday for Rajya Sabha and on Wednesday for Lok Sabha. I can’t even count how many times during this session I heard the quorum bell ringing shrill, begging the members to come inside the house and let the business continue.

For the uninitiated, quorum is the minimum number of members that have to be present for the business in the house to be conducted. Under article 100(3) of the Constitution, for both houses of Parliament and State Assemblies, the quorum is one-tenth of the total strength of the house. So basically, in Lok Sabha, 53 members need to be present in order to let the house function.

Here’s the funny thing though, the quorum is considered only if a member present in the house brings it to the notice of the speaker. There is a certain ‘young’ Congress MP who can be spotted constantly counting the number of members present (I can’t name this person, for obvious reasons). The moment he sees that the members are below 53, he screams, “MADAMMMM! QUORUMMMM!?” 

Then he sits back with a smirk on his face as the speaker sighs, halts the business and the quorum bell rings.

**Fun fact**: There are two different sounding (and extremely shrill) quorum bells for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. They can be heard throughout the premises and all conversations are cut short. There are separate sounding bells for division of the house calls too. The members are supposed to rush into the house when these bells ring. Super irritating, if you ask me. If it were upto me, I would use the following as quorum bells:

[Lok Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2jONIjrM0)

[Rajya Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg)

**Fun Fact 2:** The Quorum bell was rung when the Finance Bill and Aadhaar Bill were being considered. It was rung multiple times when the debate on Water Crisis was underway. Gives you an idea about the state of affairs.

**Why was the Lok Sabha adjourned early?**

Because the government didn’t seem to have any legislative business left. The Lok Sabha was supposed to continue till May 13, but was shut down on May 11. 

After the Uttarakhand Appropriation bill was passed, there was nothing left to do. So, as an afterthought, the discussion on drought and water crisis continued for two days. Since the session is coinciding with five state elections, a lot of members were absent from the house. I don’t recall AIADMK MPs participating even in a single debate this session. So basically, maintaining quorum was becoming a big issue and probably that’s why they decided to adjourn Lok Sabha early.

#Pillar Fight!
___

There has been a silent battle raging between our Judiciary, Legislature and Executive. In the past one month, there are many seemingly disconnected events that happened, but if you look closer you will see a tiny silk thread running through them all. Last week, during a debate on Uttarakhand appropriating bill, the Pillar Fight came to the forefront. The story is quite convoluted, so hold on to your [tin-foil hats](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/69852/3449330-tumblr_loq5o7rd4n1qzl8s1o1_400.gif)!

**The Battle of Uttarakhand**

The Uttarakhand ‘crisis’ came to a conclusion last week after Harish Rawat won the floor test, got on to his horse and [galloped away into the sunset](https://67.media.tumblr.com/ff9fd687b5bb1a3256eef3428074b7bb/tumblr_nytqw4xu7G1u9i37so1_400.gif). The floor test was ordered by the Supreme Court and it was to take place without the speaker of the 70 member assembly conducting it. The whole hand-raising ceremony was recorded and the video was sent to SC for verification. News Channels were showing Rawat praying to god almighty for saving his seat and, in the process, getting a lot of sympathy from his voters.

(**PERSONAL POLITICAL COMMENT:** I won’t be surprised if, come February, he goes around the state, addressing election rallies and screaming “MODI TRIED TO CONQUER US! BUT WE FRIKKIN WON!!” The ‘outsider invaded our land’ pitch can be quite compelling. Remember Independence Day? No no, not the Indian Freedom Struggle, I was talking about the movie where aliens attack and humans win and then everyone makes out in the end and are all happy and shit. Same thing. So, well done BJP!)


**Uttarakhand Appropriation Bill, 2016** 

>“Speaker is the roxxx. He/she is Supreme”

>~ Indian National Congress


Before the crucial floor test happened on Tuesday, the government of the day seemed to be in a weird sort of hurry to get the state’s budget passed in Parliament on Monday. I’m yet to figure out why but the Finance Minister, in his opening statement, said that this was being passed so that the state can continue with its expenditure for the next four months. He said, if the budget is not passed by the Assembly, the state won’t be allowed to spend any money.

[Jaitley Logic](http://imgur.com/RCstARp)

The president’s rule (under Rule 356) was imposed on Uttarakhand on 27th March 2016, a day before the floor test was supposed to happen. Since then, the assembly has been in a state of ‘suspended animation’. The central government was of the opinion that the Speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly did not conduct the house as per the book, that he let the state budget pass even though the Uttarakhand Government didn’t have the required votes.

[What if the Speaker is being a complete ass?](http://imgur.com/rX785ih)

Members of INC argued here that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) has a right to conduct the house as he/she pleases. They also held the belief that the Court (Pillar of Judiciary) has a right to question the decision of the President (Pillar of Executive) too. On, 21st April, the Nainital High Court had scrapped the President’s Rule in Uttarakhand, thus challenging the President. 

**Aadhaar Bill, 2016**

> “Speaker is the suxxx. He/she is NOT Supreme.”

> ~ Indian National Congress

Now here's the weird part. 

Incidentally, in case of the Aadhaar Bill, 2016, the Indian National Congress has challenged the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to classify the Aadhaar Bill as a money bill. Jairam Ramesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, the hearing for which is scheduled soon. I have been talking about this case for a while now, so you can read more about it [here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking).

In this case, INC has argued that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) is *not* supreme and her decision can be challenged by the Court (Pillar of Judiciary). 

I know I know. It’s utterly confusing. It’s also rather amusing how INC can speak in favour *and* against the same bloody thing. Takes some talent to pull it off.

**So which pillar wins?**

Zoom out a little. 

Imagine these three pillars, side by side. 

The height of the Legislative Pillar is decided by a party’s strength in the Parliament. At the moment, the Pillar of Legislature is standing tall (#MudiRoxx). As with the case with every party in power at the center, they try to find ways and means to infringe and cut down the powers of the other two pillars. 

*In the case of Uttarakhand Assembly*, Legislature was taken over by Executive and both of these pillars were shot down by the Judiciary.

*In the case of Aadhaar Bill*, the Judiciary is challenging the Legislature by questioning its highest functionary, the speaker. Since the Bill has been assented to by the President, they also end up challenging the Executive. If the SC rules that Aadhaar is #NotAMoneyBill and strike it down, it gives a decision against the Executive too.

This battle was underlined by Arun Jaitley with a singular suggestion to the Speaker of Lok Sabha, that if the Supreme Court summons her in the Aadhaar case: **She should ignore them!**

[Madam Speaker, ignore. Just ignore.](http://imgur.com/Lf89cDo)

[Obligatory song dedicated to Mr Jaitley](https://youtu.be/1M8vei3L0L8?t=26s)

The Pillar Fight rages on and much popcorn has been consumed in the process. I am single-handedly making Act II profitable.

53 members retired from the Rajya Sabha last week after serving 6 years in the house, being awesome and stuff. Prime Minister Modi gave a [farewell speech] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k-HZIMs9xc) on the occasion, which is worth giving a watch (HINDI ALERT).

Before you go further, let me say, **“No. The BJP will not get majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2019.”**

[Here’s a good article explaining why](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/in-this-term-modi-govt-will-never-have-the-numbers-in-rajya-sabha/)

**Psst... Umm… Noob question: How are Rajya Sabha Members elected?**

*Don’t be embarrassed if you don’t know! Let me give you a simple rundown of how this whole shindig works. If you already know, feel free to skip this part.*

To put it simply, Rajya Sabha (aka State Council) Members are elected by the people you elect for state assemblies. There is a proportional voting system in place which decides how many members from different political parties will represent a state in the upper house. 

IRL, the party boss decides who gets a Rajya Sabha ticket. The majority political party in the assembly gets to send more members than other parties. The number of RS seats per state are decided according to the population of the state. A member elected for Rajya Sabha serves a term of six years.

The Rajya Sabha, unlike the Lok Sabha, is *never* dissolved. 1/3rd Members of RS resign every two years making the house a perpetual entity. [Here](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/memberstatewise.aspx) is a list of the seats held by each state, present vacancies and other such details.

The Rajya Sabha bid a tearful adieu to retiring members who were given a chance to express their emotions. They did express their emotions and how! I have done the painstaking job of going through the debates and pulling out interesting bits which turned the Rajya Sabha into a *nukkad sabha*. 

Much fun was had!

*(Most of this was in Hindi, so for the benefit of my non-hindi speaking [comarades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NJbxEgf3Uo), I will try to translate it in a crude manner.)*

- Ram Gopal Yadav (Samajwadi Party) [recalled an anecdote](http://imgur.com/qjtuXlz): Two American politicians were sitting together discussing the relevance of the Senate (Upper House). The Senator amongst them was sipping tea, he simply blew on the tea and looked back at the other. “What does this mean?” asked the noob amongst the two. The Senator replied, “The Upper house cools down the decisions taken by the lower house. It’s like cooling tea so you don’t burn your tongue.”

- SS Roy (Trinamool Congress) [broke into a Mukesh song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDbwkKDWJ-4), explaining (in poetic terms) how members of Rajya Sabha will come back if the High Command wishes them to do so.

- Chandan Mitra (Bharatiya Janata Party) [recalled the lines of Faiz Ahmed Faiz](http://imgur.com/mUekcBY):

>“You know and I know,

> Both of our paths separate today,

> Even if you travel far, do remember me,

> Never say goodbye, Never say goodbye.”

- Dr KP Ramalingam (AIADMK) [quoted from Thirukkural](http://imgur.com/vFrXBVG), an ancient Tamil epic.

- The Subramanianator trolled V Hanumantha Rao (Indian National Congress) [even during his farewell speech](http://imgur.com/UK5eV4m). You gotta love that guy!

- VP Singh Badnore (BJP) [quoted John Keats’s “Ode to Melancholy”](http://imgur.com/uqxQoL8).



- Chairman Hamid Ansari (The Coolest Man Alive) [trolled](http://imgur.com/Pf9anKg) Tarun Vijay (BJP) by asking him to use his immense rhetorical skills and confine the speech to three minutes. Jaya Bachchan joined the trolling my asking members who speak too much to conclude their speech in two lines. #AnsariRocks 

- Tarun Vijay [roared back](http://imgur.com/4ibVzoL) with a *sher*. (#SelfThoo)

> “Let us do full enemy-enemy, but keep some space,

> If we ever become friends, we must not feel shame.”

- KC Tyagi (JDU) was in [full stand-up mode](http://imgur.com/mXJQv9Z). He started off by telling Ansari that he is going back to being a wild-child. “I will break Section 144 and do long duration discussions in Unparliamentary language,” he said. **“LOL,”** said everyone else.

Its been 60 days. Why can't she just get over it?,157,33uoij,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/33uoij/its_been_60_days_why_cant_she_just_get_over_it/,119,1430021832,"There is this girl I know. I initially befriended her, then did some business with her, and eventually convinced her into agreeing to live with me.

Then for 200 days, I raped her. I brainwashed her, I taught her what to think, and I raped her some more.

But I also fed her, took care of her medical expenses, and introduced her to Netflix - something she'd have never experienced the joy of if she wasn't my captive. 

After about 200 days, it was becoming difficult for me to keep hold of her. My finances were in ruin due to other issues so I decided to free her. I gave her the freedom to leave and patted myself on the back for freeing her.

Meanwhile, during her time as my sex-slave, she developed a Stockholm syndrome - a part of her had fallen in love with me and started to look up to me, glorify me, and imitate me.  

However, since I set her free, she hasn't been able to do well. She's not been able to find a job, not been able to create any savings, has a dysfunctional thought process, cannot execute things properly. 

But  it has been 60 days since I set her free. If she can't get her things in order in such a long time, how can anyone blame my 200 days of rape for it? 

I mean if she can't get her house in order even after 60 days, its completely her fault. A large part of her even agrees with me on this.

However, there is this small part of her brain that keeps talking about how she has PTSD from my rape. I keep telling her that this is a deluded fascist part of her brain that is making up fiction about how it could have been if I had not raped her. I mean duh, she'd have never heard of Netflix. Besides, everyone else was raping too so its not really my fault.

In any case, this fascist part of her brain talks about justice and vengeance against me for my rape. But I prefer to ignore and not talk about those old days. Sometimes I even tell her that the rape was good for her. I suggest that its best we ignore the past and build on our special relationship and continue to work together for a better future for the both of us. She agrees with me for the most part except when her fascist mindset kicks in.

"I feel I am being economically forced to choose a career (MBA) that I don't necessarily want(?), while my true passion lies somewhere else.",11,85cyx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/85cyx9/i_feel_i_am_being_economically_forced_to_choose_a/,9,1521425579,"TDLR: I got a offer letter from a good MBA university in India, but I don't feel my passion truly lies in MBA, rather it lies in bio-sciences. However, career in pure sciences isn't exactly promising and stable, definitely not in India, but maybe abroad.

Last year I completed my BSc from Mumbai University with fairly nice grades and I am currently at the end of 1st year of my MSc. I hate it here. I don't feel like I am learning anything new at all. It's repetition of what we did in BSc. I want to leave this MSc to go for a MS in Germany (Not any other country because I can only afford the tuition fee subsidised German education, not even the elite science institutes in India because lack of a MS in bio engineering, the pathetic state of research in India even in the elite instis, the horrible scientific culture of India, in short I don't want to study science in India.) in TU Dresden or Munich or Max planck or similar. I have friends there who are just on my head to give IELTS and apply for my dream MS institute. My dad now feebly supports this plan too so no family problem.

There are some major caveats to this career line. Firstly it is too hyper specialised and in it's infancy. Very few businesses are offering jobs to bio engineers. So my best option is to stay there in Germany and do a PhD. Not that it is a terrible option but again the question of 'then what' arises. This is more of less the same situation in every pure science field with a lot of unknowns and variables. What I desperately want to avoid is being in a situation where I am not getting opportunities in Germany and I have to come back home with a degree that isn't worth anything in India. 

This is one option that I have currently which isn't promising, I haven't even applied to these institutes yet. Too much uncertainty with respect to career, financing and opportunities. But it has my passion. And passion isn't something I say lightly. I am so interested in fields biology that I have that I have spent hours and hours of reading one Wikipedia article after another like a crack addict drugging himself to keep his high. Here I am referring just one page of an interesting topic and boom 8 hours later, I have 50 tabs open on my browser and I am reading a research paper on tissue engineering and its future applications. One could say I am passionate about biology. 

The problem is, I also like making money. I will just say it flatly. I am just as passionate of making money as I am passionate of biology. And it is difficult to have a comfortable career in Biology AND owning that house I dream of or buying that latest PC rig or god forbid, a good retirement plan. I have seen what lack of money did to my family and I never want to be in a position where I have to borrow money from someone or rent some shitty apartment. I want to provide for my future wife and children.(I know this prospect is little premature for that but still.)

Hence I went into the MBA rat race, joined classes, studied, and after a hellish year of self loathing and realising how pathetic I am in maths, I have an offer letter from one of the top ten B-schools of India. It isn't some MBA finance or some god level MBA, I just don't have the calibre for it and I didn't score high enough on the tests for fiance, but it is MBA in pharmaceuticals. The course is amazing. A lot of learning opportunities, 100% placement, average package 8 lakhs, lowest 6, highest 14, lot of field experience and 2 or 3 seniors last year bagged international placements in pharma MNCs. Kewl.

Everyone around me is elated and happy and congratulating me and I am here sitting just confused more than ever. It is indeed a big break for me, I have been depressed and miserable for 2 years, tensed about what I will do in life. So a part of me ( and my dad ) feel I should just accept what is on my plate right now and not demand for something better. 

The truth is, my MBA entrance exam attempts this year wasn't even 60% of my total potential. And I feel I could do a lot better and get that prestigious MBA Finance from NMIMS, JB, XLRI, or some mid tier IIMs. IIM ABC ka aukaad nai hai mera so I am not even thinking of those. My CMAT score was 96 percentile. What if I score better next year? If I choose MBA pharma this year, there's no turning back, I will be propelled in the pharma industry. I don't know how to sell drugs.

I feel I am being economically forced to choose MBA, but I am not exactly complaining because MBA has money, science doesn't, while science has my passion, but no money. I know I am making a blanket statement here but certainly there are exceptions, but you get my general idea right. I know that I should have made this decision long ago, but I didn't feel like I will get into any good B school.

One small possibility I see is, doing an MBA in pharma and working in a biomedical devices company which is something close to my passion. 

MBAs of reddit, scientists of reddit in india and overseas, and anyone who might have some suggestions, what should I do? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option? What would you do? I have to confirm my MBA admission in 10 days. I have only 10 days to decide how I am going to lead the rest of my life. I would seriously appreciate some counsel. 

Thank you.",6

Even though the exchanges & crypto community in India are seeking remedial action against RBI's diktat, I am not very hopeful that we'll be able to get a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in favour of crypto-currencies. The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)

Not many users out here know that [Indian crypto markets crashed flat 25-30%](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/with-rbi-s-near-ban-announcement-cryptocurrency-prices-crash-sharply-118040501410_1.html) in less than an hour of RBI notification on **April 5, 2018** because of panic selling by investors whereas the foreign exchanges didn't show any substantial fluctuations because of the same.

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future. Personally, I won't be much surprised if XRP value comes down to 0.05$-0.10$ at that time. Without any exception, same shall be the fate of other VCs too.

So, the opportunity lies for those who have accounts with foreign banks since they shall be able to procure cryptocurrencies at dirt cheap prices here in India and be able to sell them abroad at the normal prices prevailing in world markets. This shall be beneficial for both categories of people, those looking to profit out of arbitrage and those intending to HODL them. I admit this post benefits only some investors based on their geographical presence and not the cryptoverse at large but one should make the most of what she/he has. *When life throws rocks at you, build a fort out of them.* ;)

Looking forward to positive feedback from you all :)",6

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

Millions of frustrated math students in schools across India have complained a million times about how nobody is ever going to use pythagorean theorems in real life.

As part of an effort to create a responsible taxpaying society, tax officials are set to [visit](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/i-t-officials-set-to-give-moral-science-lessons-in-schools/articleshow/53164515.cms) schools armed with powerpoints and statistics to teach kids all about taxes including how black money and tax evasion harms the economy.

**Pandering To The Base**

Every politician does it. From the Donald in the US to Modi in India, it’s a political science lesson that crosses borders. As much as we parade the “developing-nation” tag around, India’s economy is still heavily dependant on agriculture as it employs almost two-thirds of the nation’s people. And these farmers also constitute Modi’s base and naturally, his government needs to pander to them before the forth-coming state elections. After a union budget that was largely seen as pro-farmer by earmarking almost $826 million (₹5,524 crore) for crop insurance plans, the government might play two more cards to appease the backbone of the economy. One, officials said last week that they are considering imposing a [penalty](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-crop-insurance-idUSL3N16U22P) on delaying of claim settlements for crop insurance. That’s when you buy insurance and if the rains don’t come in and your crops fail, you get paid a settlement. Two, the government is likely to extend the the current 25% wheat import tax which expires in March to continue [beyond](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-wheat-duty-idINKCN0WN1H7) March. The tax was imposed to shield domestic wheat farmers from cheap imports. Wasn’t exactly effective since wheat output in 2015 was down 10% from 2014, despite the tax.


**The Great Indian Addiction**

Indian people are addicted. It’s not a drug, gambling or internet addiction. It’s an addiction to gold. Gold imports make up a quarter of India’s trade deficit because we import almost 10 lakh kgs of gold annually. Billionaire Warren Buffett says about gold: “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”  Clearly, Indian people think that Buffett uncle doesn’t know anything about gold. Rehabilitating the Indian people from this addiction can be hard but the government is trying. Recently, it introduced a 1% excise duty on imported gold jewellry. How did that go down? Jewellers went on an indefinite strike which was called off last week after [assurances](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-strike-idINKCN0WM01T) that excise department officials won’t harass jewellers. The government also started a campaign to monetize the privately owned horde of Indian gold to cut down on imports. How has that worked out? The scheme only managed to attract 0.015% of the estimated horde of gold that is currently in family lockers and temple vaults. There was some golden news on that front last week as the iconic 200-year-old [Siddhivinayak](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-siddhihvinayak-temple-idINKCN0WK1ZF) temple in Mumbai announced its participation in the scheme.

**Because Karma Is A Bitch**

Petty sabotage and backstabbing isn’t just limited to undercover spies and Indian politics anymore. The corporates are adopting these strategies as well. Last week, Uber filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court against its biggest Indian competitor, Ola. The lawsuit accuses Ola of creating 90,000 fake Uber accounts and using them to book over 400,000 rides, only to be cancelled at the last [moment](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292310/uber-ola-lawsuit-india-fake-rides-lyft). Classic prank by Ola, right? Except Uber claims that Ola did this to disrupt its operations and frustrate its drivers. And Uber would know that because it has been accused of doing the exact same thing to its biggest US competitor, Lyft. Two years ago, Lyft accused Uber of booking and cancelling over 5,000 rides using fake accounts that were traced back to Uber employees. If true, Ola will only have taken a page from Uber’s own playbook. If you’re a betting person, be sure to put your money on Uber - that company’s got deep pockets and can drag this out as long as it takes. It recently declared $1 billion (₹6,688 crore) in annual profits from it’s [top 30](http://www.newsweek.com/uber-profits-elsewhere-support-sustainable-spending-china-ceo-440705) cities alone. To be fair, they also said they were sustaining huge losses in China where the company holds a 30% market share.

**Auto Engines Are The New Moon Landing**

69th Richest Indian on the famous Forbes Rich-list and the co-founder of Infosys, Nandan Nilekani is known for investing in startups that focus on big, transformative ideas. In his investment portfolio is Team Indus, a company that aims to land a rover on the moon and Systemantics, a company that focuses on robots. Last week, Nilekani made his [biggest](http://thetechportal.in/2016/03/24/sedemac-mechatronics-funding/) startup investment yet in a company called Sedemac Mechatronics. What’s bigger than futuristic robots and landing on the moon? Time travel, perhaps? No, apparently, it’s building small engines and powertrains for auto companies. Nilekani led the latest round of funding in Sedemac which summed up to a total of $7.5 million (₹50 crore). Sedemac counts the big boys of the auto industry like Tata Motors, Mahindra Group, Ashok Leyland as its clients and was started by an engineering professor at IIT-B with a couple of fellow IITians.

**The Chinese Dragon Wants In On India**

The “Big Three” of e-commerce in India - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon - will soon become the “Big Four” with the entry of Alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant in India. Officials from the company that is poised to [surpass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Alibaba-on-course-to-become-worlds-top-retailer/articleshow/51507633.cms) the world’s biggest retailer, Walmart and claim that tag for itself, said last week that Alibaba was looking to expand its presence in India. It is looking to directly enter the online retail segment later this year. Run by China’s richest person, Jack Ma, the company already owns 40% of Paytm and 4% of Snapdeal. Are Indian e-commerce companies coming together like brothers-in-arms to fight off competition from this foreign entity? Of course no. The Indians didn’t unite when the British literally invaded and aren’t going to do that now with the Chinese either. In fact, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal and his Snapdeal counterpart Kunal Bahl already found themselves in a war of words on [Twitter](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/flipkart-s-sachin-bansal-takes-jibe-at-alibaba-s-india-entry-116032600040_1.html) over Alibaba’s planned expansion in India. Alibaba, which still conjures images of forty thieves in one’s imagination, may tie up with the [Tatas](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-21/news/71705366_1_digital-india-alibaba-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry) to launch its online retail business as a joint-venture. This is because FDI regulations still don’t allow foreign companies to sell directly to Indian consumers, which is what Alibaba wants to do. Amazon, the US ambassador to the industry, merely connects buyers and sellers and doesn’t sell itself.

**Oli Gets Oil**

Nepal’s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli recently took a trip up north to Beijing and stumbled his way into signing an agreement with China for the supply of petroleum products to [Nepal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nepal-idUSKCN0WP1WV). The country, which serves as a strategic buffer between India and China, adopted its first post-monarchy constitution last year. But protesters opposing the new constitution blocked trucks carrying fuel and essential goods coming from India. This five-month long “unofficial blockade” of Nepal had disastrous consequences for the Nepalese economy due to its overwhelming dependence on India. The distraught country says it now wants to import 33% of Nepal’s fuel from China in the future. Basically, after being deeply hurt by what the Indians did, Nepal is now looking for some quick rebound action from the Chinese. Indian officials, however, are far from alarmed that Nepal is trying to move away from the Indian sphere of influence. Why? Because there is this big huge chunk of rock called the Himalayas between Nepal and China.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

3. ""Bizarrely, securities backed by mortgages sold to people without the income to service the debt they were taking on were being judged a better credit risk than the sovereign government of Japan, with the ability in extremis both to raise taxes and print money to avoid a default.""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

5.""Who's to Blame for the Economy? Rating Agencies - A good measure of who is responsible for getting us into this mess is looking at who got rich off of it. Bond ratings agencies certainly got their share of the take.

Moody's Investors Service ( MCO) saw its profits quadruple between 2000 and 2007 and had a higher profit margin than any other company in the S&P 500 for five straight years, according to opening statements from Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, in a congressional hearing on the ratings agencies he held in October.""

6. "" In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the rating agencies came under criticism from investigators, economists, and journalists. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)[39] set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (FCIR), concluded that the ""failures"" of the Big Three rating agencies were ""essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction"" and ""key enablers of the financial meltdown"".[40] It went on to say

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.""

7. Wikipedia page on Credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agencies_and_the_subprime_crisis#Legal_actions

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

Accordingly, Mallya [says](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vijay-mallya-fugitive-businessman-consider-india-return-if-safety-freedom-assured-1560279) he’ll only return if his safety and freedom is assured. GOI’s formal request to the British government to extradite Mallya was declined. More problems to boot: A ₹2.4 crore dividend payable to Mallya from United Breweries was withheld.

**2020: Double the Coal, Double the Asthma**

Tesla Motors of the United States just launched the Model 3 electric car that can run entirely on solar power, reducing any climate effects since it doesn’t need gasoline. Piyush Goyal of the Indian Power and Coal Ministry, on the other hand, just assured everyone that India will indeed [double] (http://profit.ndtv.com/news/commodities/article-india-to-rely-on-state-miners-to-meet-coal-target-piyush-goyal-1291421) its coal production by 2020, increasing every imaginable climate effect. So the government wants to increase coal production to 1.5 billion tonnes by 2020. State-owned Coal India ([COALINDIA](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ACOALINDIA&ei=vtABV7DnAtbajAGNr57QBQ)), India’s largest coal mining company, is already on track to increase its own production to 1 billion tonnes by 2020. The private sector was expected to pick up the tab for the remaining half a billion tonnes. But since the private sector companies are strapped for cash and can’t increase coal production to meet the target, the coal minister is pushing for other state-owned companies like NTPC ([NTPC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANTPC&ei=XtEBV7n2CoSA2AaLz7vwCA)), National Aluminium Co ([NATIONALUM](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANATIONALUM&ei=ndEBV6GTBISe2AbWvIy4AQ)) to step up their coal production so the government can meet that target. “Renewables? Climate change? Pollution? Asthma? What do those words even mean?” - Piyush Goyal (paraphrased).

**No Smoking**

A group of cigarette manufacturing companies led by ITC Ltd. ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC&ei=rNEBV-GJHMP02AbI5KiABQ)) through the Tobacco Institute of India have shut down all cigarette manufacturing facilities since [April 1st](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-itc-not-ready-to-print-bigger-health-warnings-on-cigarette-packs-factories-to-remain-shut-2197282). The stated reason for this is because of the ‘ambiguity’ over the size of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages. Every cigarette packet is mandated by law to have horrible pictures of Satan’s lungs over them to discourage smoking. While a parliamentary committee had recommended the size of those pictures to be 50% of the packaging, the health ministry had ordered for the figure to be 85%. Not knowing which figure to follow, the cigarette manufacturers have decided to just shut down all operations and take daily losses of ₹350 crore. The theory behind the size of the pictures being - larger the picture, lesser the smoking. If you listen hard, you can almost hear the patron saint of anti-smoking ads, Mukesh turning in his grave thinking of what would’ve been if only the 85% sized pictures had come in his lifetime.

**Buybacks and Dividends to the Rescue!**

The Indian football team can’t set goals to win the FIFA World Cup 2018, unfortunately that’s just not realistic. And one of the basic rules of setting goals is that they should be realistically achievable. But somebody in the government never got that memo. After five consecutive years of failing to achieve targets of money raised through disinvestment, the government still set an all-time record [high](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/PAYP49n1pV885tWIPO7d3J/Disinvestment-scorecard-Govt-a-to-miss-target-16th-tim.html) target for this year. So it shouldn’t exactly be a surprise when it misses targets this year as well, which will be the 16th time in 25 years now. But unrealistic targets also lead to desperate actions to fulfill those targets. In this case, the government is looking at buybacks and special [dividends](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Govt-banks-on-unlisted-PSUs-to-mop-up-Rs-5k-cr-this-week/articleshow/51577307.cms) from unlisted state-owned companies like Hindustan Aeronautics and others. The extra cash in those companies will now be used to buy shares back from the government and declare special dividends amounting to almost ₹5,000 crore to help the government meet targets this year. Who wants to bet we’ll still miss targets this year and set an even higher target for next year?

**BJP’s Beef Ban Backfires**

(pause for reader to appreciate that alliteration) As a part of the BJP’s beef ban that was introduced in BJP-ruled states last year, it is prohibited to sell your cattle for slaughter. For people living in cities drinking Starbucks coffee, that’s hardly a problem since they don’t really own a lot of cattle. But for farmers living in villages drinking unfiltered water, that’s a huge [problem](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-beef-idINKCN0WU1UQ). If the rains don’t show up for a particular year, the crops fail and the farmer sells his cattle to feed his family. And when the rains do show up the next year, the crops blossom and the farmer buys the cattle back. But the beef ban just threw a wrench in this cycle by making it harder for people to sell their cows. Cattle prices have fallen across the country, by almost 40 to 60 percent in one district of Maharashtra and India’s meat exports have dropped 13%. This comes at a time when the government is trying very hard to appease farmers in a bid to win state elections later this year.

**For Sale: Tata Steel UK, Condition: Slightly Used**

On second thoughts, slightly used might not be the correct way of describing Tata Steel’s UK business. ‘Abused by the Chinese’ might be more accurate. Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL&ei=3NEBV-H3IceJ2AbIrarYCw)) entered the UK Steel market by acquiring Corus, a company that was three times bigger than itself for $8.1 billion (₹53,654 crore) in 2007. Fast forward to two months ago, it declared a [loss](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/tata-steel-reports-third-quarter-loss-chinese-imports) of £68 million (₹641 crore) after suffering from cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs and weak demand. Last week, Tata Steel announced that it was putting up its entire UK business on the [auction](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot) block. The problem is: no one’s bidding. The UK government is even debating on just nationalizing the whole business to prevent mass layoffs and to protect what is an important part of the British economy. Of course, that’ll only be temporary nationalization until suitable buyers from the private sector can be found. Otherwise, it’ll be socialism (gasp).

**100% FDI in E-commerce *T&C Apply**

Millions of family-owned corner stores across India have moaned and complained since forever against e-commerce companies taking their customers away. And with Amazon gaining a foothold and Alibaba planning an Indian expansion, the e-commerce field in India is increasingly being dominated by foreign companies. The corner store guys were having none of this and filed a lawsuit saying this was illegal since foreign companies aren’t exactly allowed to set up retail operations in India. After years of uncertainty, we finally have a ruling on this - foreign companies are now legally allowed to set up e-commerce operations in India, but terms and conditions [apply](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec51a45e-f5be-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d.html#axzz44oZbeUBy) (don’t they always?). These companies can’t sell directly to customers, but can only connect buyers and sellers. No single seller can account for more than 25% of sales. And these companies can not set prices themselves to offer discounts, as many do now to attract customers. Buy that smartphone for cheap while you can, the days of deep discounts may end before you know it.

I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward,8,7jrv4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jrv4g/i_am_forwarding_an_interesting_story_about_world/,8,1513290195,"Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!

I am stuck in a bad situation and I was hoping you could help me by guiding me on what to do or pointing to someone who could maybe guide me

**What I need help with** : Choosing a path to land a job as soon as possible

**What my problem is :** Was an entrepreneur for 3 years - I have only generalist skills, no employable skills. And I dont have money saved up. 

Some histroy -

I'm an Engineer with an MBA in Banking and Finance [Finished mba  2 years back from a top-12 college in India]. Right out of college I landed a job as a business analyst at a good IT firm [not Infosys/tcs etc] but I didn’t join that company and instead went into the family business.


Since  early 2014, I have been working for my 3 family businesses and done all sorts of general-ish stuff [One's a new school, another an industrial equipment manufacturing factory and the the third is a construction firm making residential apartments]


* in 2014, Worked towards planning, execution, purchase related stuff of construction of our school - involved dealing with suppliers, contractors etc


* In 2015, Worked in day to day planning, execution, management of our industrial manufacturing unit. Did lot of touring for this, to build better relationship with our clients and suppliers. I have experience of B2B marketing, building and maintaining client and supplier relationships etc]


* In 2016, in the construction firm, I oversaw and completed a small residential project and involved in a lot of aspects. Ive gone abroad in exhibitions and done B2C marketing, involved in sales and marketing department, designing/tweaking online ad campaigns, decision making for local sales channels like hoardings etc, supervision of day to day work on construction site etc. I believe I have a baisc working knowledge of the construction industry now.

However, now I am looking for a job since I haven’t earned anything in the past 3 years. **I cant take money from my family now due to a complicated situation. I am completely on my own** ,  There are no future earning prospects from the business for me, and my only way to survive is by taking up a job. Unfortunately, I don’t have any employable skills. I just don’t know what to do.


**I need a path to a job.** What is something I can do to land a job as quickly as possible. Can a person like me even get a job now ? I’m age 27 .


I was looking at 3 fields, but all involve a  lengthy studying time/skill acquisition time and less chance of getting a job – and time is something I don’t have : study finance to land a financial analyst job , study applied statistics to land a data analytics job – or somehow try to apply for business analyst job [by refreshing my domain knowledge from MBA]. I see a very very slim chance of me getting a job in these fields

Another thing I was thinking of was either take coaching for 10th standard Science/Maths or teach for MBA Entrance like CAT/GMAT etc. But how would I go about getting hired by a coaching center ?

Please help me.

tl;dr - help an unemployable, penniless ex-entrepreneur land a job.",6

You can slice open that term “bull market” in a hundred different ways, but American markets today are pretty much where they were when the year began.

**Killing Tax Havens - One Treaty At A Time**

Question - What country ranks second in the share of foreign portfolio investments made in the Indian stock market? Answer - First of all, that is a very specific question to ask. And second of all, if you [answered](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-12/news/73039798_1_tax-treaty-capital-gains-tax-mauritius) Mauritius, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s not that ~~Martian~~ Mauritian citizens are crazy about Indian stocks, Mauritius is just an island that is even smaller than Mumbai and Delhi put together. It’s that investments made through Mauritius were exempt from Indian capital gains taxes - which essentially transformed Mauritius into a tax haven. It was all legal under a 30-year old treaty between the two countries that was signed in 1983. Ahh, the 1980s - when the Panama Papers wasn’t a thing, the accountants didn’t have to worry about ethics, and writing physical letters was actually cool and not just hipster cool. But all that and more is changing. Under an amendment to the treaty that was [agreed](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/u4AzTTKA5vCRJBWhANkuZN/Some-FAQs-on-the-Mauritius-tax-treaty.html) upon last week, India will begin imposing a capital gains tax on all future investments made through the country. This gives existing investors some wiggle room, and doesn’t trigger a crash in case existing investors decide to pull out.


**Raghu’s Second Term**

Time flies when you’re having fun, and it’s already time for another governor at the RBI. Current governor Raghuram Rajan’s term is about to end in September and there’s some awkward tension in the air about his reappointment since Rajan’s crusade against bad loans is expected to be done by March 2017, a full 6 months after his term expires. Chosen under former PM Manmohan Singh’s administration, Rajan [says](http://www.businessinsider.in/RBIs-Raghuram-Rajan-keeps-mum-about-second-term-but-reveals-his-backup-plan/articleshow/52185985.cms) he hasn’t been asked if he wants to continue as governor and intends to go back to teaching when he’s done. He can act as coy as he wants, but everyone knows that he wants to continue as governor. Who wouldn’t? It’s like asking an olympic gold winner if he’d like to continue winning the gold. However, the newest member of the Rajya Sabha, Subramanian Swamy, has [stated](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/send-raghuram-rajan-back-to-chicago-subramanian-swamys-new-attack-1405498) that Rajan is unsuitable to run the RBI and shouldn’t be reappointed. Swamy says that Rajan should instead pack up his bags and go to the US, where he is a professor at the University of Chicago. ‘Go back to (insert country here)’ seems to be a recurring theme lately.

**EPF Changes: Strike Three?**

At first they tried to tax your EPF withdrawals. But that didn’t work out. Then, they tried to restrict EPF withdrawals until you’re 58. But that didn’t work out either. Now, they are back. And this time, they want to help you buy a house. A new scheme currently under discussion would [allow](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/epfo-members-to-benefit-as-govt-plans-low-cost-housing-scheme-for-over-5-cr-subscribers/251510/) you to pledge future EPF contributions as installments towards buying a house. Here’s how it would work: You go out and try to find your ultimate dream house. You give up and settle on one that your wife likes, because you just want to get this over with. Then you find a bank that doesn’t think you’re Mallya 2.0 and gives you a home loan. And now, your future EPF contributions can count as installments on the home loan. But you also have to be a low-income first-time home buyer to qualify. The last two times any modifications to the EPF system have been proposed, they have backfired. If this were baseball, the batter is already two strikes down and might end up with a strikeout, if this backfires as well.

**Numbers You Don’t Want To Hear**

The kryptonite of any agrarian economy is a prolonged drought. Like the one we’ve been having in over 10 states for the past two years now. A recent study [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rs-650000-crore-thats-the-impact-the-drought-will-have-on-the-indian-economy-says-assocham/) the total impact of that drought on the national economy at ₹6,50,000 crore. That number is so huge, your brain is incapable of processing it. That’s because a loss of ₹100 is a tragedy, a loss of ₹100 crore is a statistic. Moving on to some much lighter news - the Indian banking [system](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-that-bad-if-you-pay-rs-150-for-a-bank-stock-rs-50-is-going-as-bad-loan/articleshow/52291846.cms) is on fire. If you spend ₹150 on buying stock in the average Indian bank right now - you’d be spending ₹50 just to purchase the bad loans that come with the bank. The skeletons could’ve stopped tumbling out at any point - but what’s the fun in that? New estimates show that the amount of bad loans in the Indian banking system might be greater than the entire economy of New Zealand. Little reminder - In statistics, you can either pick the data and write the story it supports, or you can pick the story and write the data that supports it.

**A Government of India Original**

The stage has been set - on one side, we have the world renowned economist, Raghuram Rajan and on the other side, we have the new MP on the block, Subramanian Swamy. It’s a battle of wits. It’s a battle of politics. But to find out if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI, or if Swamy successfully sends Rajan back to the US - watch out for season 2, coming this August. Apparently, the government is going to keep everyone [waiting](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-to-take-call-on-raghuram-rajan-s-rbi-term-extension-in-august-2215544) till the 11th hour and only decide if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI in August, a month before his current term expires. Just when you thought you were getting into the show, they drop a huge cliffhanger and make you wait for the next season. Don’t you hate it when that happens? We already have the protagonist and the antagonist for this plot - might as well add in some supporting characters: Uday Kotak - promoter of the Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Adi Godrej - head of the Godrej group have endorsed Rajan for a second term. Even a poll of top CEOs from corporate India found overwhelming support for Rajan. So everyone wants a second term for Rajan. But that’s the thing with season premiers - they tend to take very unexpected plot twists.


**Another Round of Startup ~~Funding~~ Troubles**

Zimply, PepperTap, Stayzilla, TinyOwl, Swiggy… these words don’t sound like words at all. And until a few years ago, they were just a bunch of typos. But today, they are all venture-funded startups that recruit from some of the best talent pools in the country, the IIMs. Or at least they used to, until the startup boom turned into a balloon that’s constantly trying to run away from thorns. In the recent round of troubles, officials in charge of placements at IIMs are annoyed with startups deferring joining dates and marking down pay packages. To take the classic example of what happened with Flipkart, the company told all new recruits from IIM-A to sit back and relax for now and join the company in December instead of joining next month. And in exchange for the lost pay which can often run into several lakhs, Flipkart will bump up the signing bonus by a sweet ₹1.5 lakh. Now, the authorities at IIM-A are not happy with [these](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/iim-ahmedabad-asks-flipkart-to-address-placement-issue-2819413/) shenanigans at all, since a lot of students have loans they need to pay back. And have warned startups that there could be consequences. Moreover, what if the students take up writing in their free time till December? India cannot afford another Chetan Bhagat right now.

**A Change of Plans**

Last August, the RBI gave approvals to 11 companies to set up payments banks. The 11 companies are some of the who’s who of the business world - Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla, Vodafone, Airtel, IDFC Bank, Tech Mahindra and many more. And then there was also the Indian Department of Posts. But what in god’s name is a payments bank, I hear you ask. A payments bank is just a normal bank, except it can’t give out loans. And before you ask the next most obvious question, they make money from fees and commissions. But increasingly, the process of chasing after the RBI to obtain these approvals is starting to resemble dogs chasing after cars. They wouldn’t know what to do if they ever caught one. Now, three entities that received approvals including IDFC Bank and Tech Mahindra are [dropping](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/tech-mahindra-drops-out-of-payments-bank-race-841548) plans to ever start a payments bank. The primary reason given for the change of plans is that competing with 11 other deep pocketed companies will result into wafer-thin profits which doesn’t make business sense. In short, simple capitalism at work. After all, chasing after things we don’t have, only to realize that we don’t want it when we do get our hands on it - is a timeless classic that is rooted deep inside all of us.

**Pakistan Is Listing Everything**

In 2013, Pakistan, our dear neighbour to the west, was about to Greece the place up by defaulting on its loans. You didn’t hear much about this because the IMF swooped in and saved the day by bailing Pakistan out to the tune of $6.7 billion. But IMF money rarely comes with no strings attached. As part of the bailout, Pakistan was required to privatize the economy by listing many of its state-owned companies on the stock exchange. Last week, the country [announced](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/world-news/pakistan-to-start-soft-marketing-state-airline-sale-in-june/263644/) that it is looking for investors as it plans to do exactly that and list over 68 companies including the Pakistan International Airlines, a bunch of steel mills and utility companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which by the way is also being listed. So if you know a friend who’s got a few million lying around - hit them up, Pakistan’s looking for investors. Or we could make a kickstarter campaign. I can kick in 50 bucks. Either way, this is definitely not Pakistan’s week. Historically, India didn’t have access to Central Asia and Afghanistan since Pakistan blocked all the land routes. But with a newly [signed](http://qz.com/690217/india-just-played-a-masterstroke-in-iran-to-reinforce-its-regional-soft-power-status-in-asia/) contract with Iran, India can potentially bypass Pakistan and trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia through a sea route to Iran and a rail link from there on.

* If you’ve been reading this series regularly, you’ve likely realized two things by now - One, there is still faith for humanity and two, there is none for the banks. Canara Bank [reported](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/wWFiLKBr59fsto0fcqlbpO/Canara-Bank-posts-Rs-3905-crore-loss-in-Q4.html) a loss of ₹3,905 crore for January-March quarter. When the davids fall like dominos, the goliaths have to be limping, at the very least. The State Bank of India, the largest bank in the country, [limped](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-q4-fy-201516-results/article8654996.ece) along with a 66% fall in net profit to ₹1,263 crore. But the bad news at SBI wasn’t as bad as everyone expected, and so shares of SBI are up 17% despite a fall in profits. Yeah. That happens. Welcome to Dalal Street.

* For years now, kulcha warriors across the nation have been screaming that all things western are literally cancer. Well, they might not be entirely wrong. After demolishing Nestle by finding lead in Maggi, the powers that be have wished the end of Domino’s Pizza, McDonald’s and Subway as well. A study by the Center for Science and Environment [found](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/india-domino-s-mcdonald-s-operators-hurt-by-bread-cancer-report) that the bread used by these companies includes a cancer-causing substance. Shares of Jubilant Foodworks (Indian partner of Domino’s) and Westlife Development (franchisee of McDonald’s) were down on the news.

* As a net importer of oil, India has raked in millions as oil prices nosedived from a high of $100 to a low of $30. But every coin has two sides - and sadly, this isn’t that double-headed coin Jai used in Sholay. In real life, the good comes with the bad. Some 7 million Indians work abroad in the oil-rich Gulf countries that have fallen on bad times, and more and more are being forced to come home. Remittances from Indians working abroad [slumped](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-remittances-idINKCN0YG2OE) 27% to $48 billion - lowest since the 2008 crisis.

* The markets have a reputation for being sensitive. They tend to react even if Raghuram Rajan so much as sneezes. So events like the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate hike, or Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union, or China’s worsening economy are all but guaranteed to sway the markets one way or another. But forget all of that. After a 2-year drought, we have a monsoon on our doorsteps that has been forecast as above average - and experts [say](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/forget-fed-brace-up-for-monsoon-bonanza-on-d-street-el-nino-is-gone/articleshow/52430422.cms), this is the event that will define the economy over the next few months.

**No Money? No Problem**

No Problem for the banks that loaned you the money - big problems for you. The Lok Sabha just [passed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0XS1NW) the landmark Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Currently, we use a patchwork of laws that govern bankruptcies in India. That patchwork has resulted in 70,000 pending cases of bankruptcies. But the new bill sets a deadline of 180 days after the business defaults on loans during which the business owners and the lenders have to reach a resolution. Failing a resolution, the lenders can then sell the business to recover dues. This country is slowing moving to a market-based economy ever since the fall of the Soviet Union. And capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell. An interesting recommendation that could end up in the law seeks to ban bankrupt people from contesting in elections. Wonder if there was any specific person that inspired this recommendation. You know, a specific person who was a businessman and a politician but also went bankrupt while receiving excessive media coverage coinciding with a time when a lot of the banks are dealing with bad loans? (*cough cough* Vijay Mallya).

**A Democratic RBI**

Currently, the RBI functions like a dictatorship with the governor being the supreme leader. Basically, while sitting in his pajamas, Raghuram Rajan can make major changes that could either launch the economy into the future or turn the economy upside down. And nobody can do anything about it. But now the Finance Bill which just [passed](http://qz.com/676943/indias-bullet-proof-central-bank-is-about-to-get-another-layer-of-armour/) the Lok Sabha and is expected to pass the Rajya Sabha as well will turn the RBI into a quasi-democracy. The bill seeks to replace the current system with a six-member panel with three representatives from the government and three from the RBI. The panel will vote on the changes to be made and Rajan will be given the tie-breaker vote. No wonder Rajan is all for the new system because one, most major central banks do it this way, two, centralized power just hasn’t work out well historically and three, in case of terrible outcomes - just point to the panel for all the blame and in case of great outcomes - bask in the glory of all the history books and mainstream media credit as the governor of the RBI.

**Flopkart**

(That title was so obvious, it had to be used.) What’s the most important law of nature? No, it’s not ‘people who wear crocs don’t get laid’. It’s the law of gravity. What goes up must come down. Just a few years ago, Flipkart was the hot new thing on the startup scene. But now competition in the space is heating up. Starting just a few months ago, minority investors in Flipkart have begun to [slash](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/more-investors-mark-down-flipkart-valuation-116050400523_1.html) the value of their shares in Flipkart. In February, Morgan Stanley marked its investments in Flipkart down by 27%. Last month, T-Rowe Price marked its investments down by 15%. And now, Fidelity and Valic slashed the value of their investments by more than 20%. It’s not just Flipkart. HSBC [published](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/zomato-demicorn/) a report that basically says Zomato is worth only half of what people say it’s worth. Is this what it felt like in 2000 just before the startup bubble popped? Zomato, which is thought to be a unicorn (a startup worth a billion dollars) might just be a demicorn (a startup worth half a billion - trademark pending). 

**The Singh Bros of Ranbaxy**

They say you should never hide information from your doctors and lawyers. Add one more to that list - a Japanese corporation that’s buying a majority stake in your business. The Singh brothers, ex-promoters of pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories, are finding out just what happens when you cross that line. In 2008, the Singh bros sold a majority stake in Ranbaxy to the Japanese corporation, Daiichi-Sankyo (with an appropriately Japanese name too). But they allegedly, hid information from Daiichi that Ranbaxy was adulterating drugs that were made in India and sold in the US. They were caught in 2013, and Daiichi-owned Ranbaxy had to pay $500 million in damages. Since Daiichi had no idea that Ranbaxy was involved in these shady dealings when it bought a majority stake in 2008, it sued the Singh brothers for hiding that information. An arbitration panel last week found the Singh brothers guilty and [asked](http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ranbaxy-owners-ordered-to-pay-385-million-to-daiichi-sankyo-1462473046) them to pay $385 million to Daiichi as damages. That’s got to be a bitter pill to swallow.

* Thank god for politicians. Savour the joy of reading those words in one sentence because it’s probably not happening again. But whenever there are elections and politicians hit the road to campaign for votes, they seem to kickstart the country’s industrial sector. The core sector output which is an Index of 8 Core Industries [went](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/core-sector-output-rises-6-4-in-march-thanks-to-politicians/articleshow/52158936.cms) up by 6.4% in March, just before states begin voting in April.

* What comes to your mind when you picture the typical Indian farmer? A skinny, frail and rural fellow struggling to make ends meet? Perhaps, the male version of that old woman in Swades standing behind a lightbulb that goes “Bijli”? Well, you’d be right most of the time but not all. Some farmers actually do pretty well for themselves. Data from the agricultural census [says](http://scroll.in/article/807603/failure-of-reforms-5-of-indias-farmers-own-a-third-of-the-land) just 5% of the farmers own over 30% of India’s farmland.

* India’s leading tobacco company, ITC cannot make up its mind. Due to a new rule requiring cigarette manufacturers to cover 85% of the packaging in pictorial warnings, ITC had previously shut down factories in protest. And later resumed production.

And then, of course, resumed production within 48 hours. Frankly, people are going to be disappointed if they don’t do the same thing next week.

* Tata Steel’s UK business has been underwater for a long time now. And the lungs are about to give up and flood water. Unless someone throws in a lifebuoy. And that someone might be Sanjeev Gupta, an Indian-origin businessman, who is [bidding](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/00a3b3c6-0fae-11e6-839f-2922947098f0.html#axzz48DXOYxhZ) to acquire Tata Steel UK. The second best contender is a buyout from Tata UK’s own management team, but it seems like the captain might not have to go down with the ship after all.

RBI slashed the interest rate on credit card dues after I sent a petition to the Honorable Prime Minister,305,2vw8p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2vw8p6/rbi_slashed_the_interest_rate_on_credit_card_dues/,60,1423968456,"Last year in May 2014, I had sent a letter about profiteering by Indian banks to the Prime Minister's Office, on the day when Mr Narendra Modi took charge. This letter mentioned several points about how banks were exploiting consumers. Some were even charging money for cash withdrawals and for counting currency. I also suggesting ways and means to make life easier for entrepreneurs and tax payers.

The entire letter can be found on my blog.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/18/letter-mr-narendra-modi-prime-minister-india-prevent-profiteering-indian-banks-and-make-lif

After over 35 years of credit cards being introduced in India, RBI has asked all banks to bring down interest rates. For all these years there has never been a cap on how much interest credit card companies could charge. Now, there will be. I'm amazed the way Modi ji and his government has acted to protect the interest of banking customers who have been exploited for decades by banks and credit card companies.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Interest-on-card-dues-set-to-drop/articleshow/46225962.cms

This was covered by Business World magazine

http://www.businessworld.in/news/banking/how-to-stop-profiteering-by-banks-&-make-life-easier-for-taxpayers/1381616/page-0.html

The Prime Minister's office (PMO) sent me a reply a few weeks later, turning my letter into a petition. A few months later I received two replies from the Reserve Bank of India and one reply from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) addressing the capital market reforms I had suggested.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/19/prime-ministers-office-turns-my-letter-about-profiteering-indian-banks-petition

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/22/sebi-sends-me-letter-responding-my-letter-honorable-prime-minister

One of the arguments that I put forth in my letter was about excessive interest rates being charged on credit card outstanding dues. To quote from my letter;

*The credit card division of banks needs to be looked at very seriously. Most banks that issue credit cards charge anywhere between 24% and 36% per annum as interest on the funds lent. Most people are not financially very savvy and this sends them into a debt trap. There is no justification for charging 36% on credit card advances when a loan to buy a scooter can be given at 15%.*

With this move, the RBI has implemented my suggestion. To quote the RBI report; *'Interest rates charged on credit card overdue were inordinately high and out of alignment with other products with similar risk profiles'.* The decision on trimming charges was taken at a conference attended by bank ombudsmen and the top rung of the RBI, which included governor Raghuram Rajan. The conference resulted in action points being drawn for the Indian Banks' Association. 

It is very heartening to see the agility with which the government has responded to my suggestions. This will, I hope, go a long way in giving a fair deal to banking consumers, increasing their purchasing power and improving the quality of life of the common man.

I also wrote a letter last month to the Honorable Finance Minister suggesting a Janta Credit Card, to eliminate black money from the economy. Please read it.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/23/my-letter-honorable-finance-minister-shri-arun-jaitley-suggesting-janta-credit-card-elimina

I'm hopeful that the PM and FM will consider implementing this solution. Apart from eliminating black money, it can go a long way towards ensuring inclusive growth, reducing the gap between the haves and have-nots, increasing India's competitiveness and ensuring employment and GDP growth.

**tl;dr: I sent a letter to the Honorable Prime Minister offering several suggestions to counter profiteering by banks, encourage entrepreneurship and reform taxation. One of the suggestions was to slash the interest rate on credit card dues. This was implemented yesterday, 35 years after credit cards were introduced in India. For the first time in our history we may actually have a cap on credit card interest rates in our country.**",6

**Earnings-Palooza Continues**

The festivities for the quarter ending March continued with Airtel [reporting](http://www.firstpost.com/business/bharti-airtels-q4-profits-up-15-per-cent-rise-in-subscribers-for-mobile-internet-2753518.html) a 3% increase in net profits and a subscriber total of 35 million Indians. Airtel’s gain turned out to be Idea’s pain. Shares of Idea traded down after the company [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/markets/indian-markets/idea-cellular-stocks-today-on-bse-sensex-nse-nifty-on-april-29-2016/245221/) almost 40% decrease in profits. That had to have hurt. The main event of the week were the banks that were reporting earnings. Profits at Axis Bank [fell](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/LlwW49im93N1GmvPrUm64H/Q4-results-Axis-Bank-profit-falls-for-the-first-time-in-46.html) almost 2% as bad loans went up - it’s the bank’s first decline in quarterly profits in over a decade. ICICI Bank, the country’s largest private sector bank, [reported](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/icici-bank-q4-profit-hit-by-provisioning-116042900307_1.html) a 76% decline in profits, the sharpest decline of quarterly profits ever in its entire history. Records like that are probably best left unbroken. Just as you breath a sign that after results like those, the worst is probably over - you realize it really isn’t. Both banks said that they expected the amount of bad loans to increase for a few quarters. Shareholders of bank stocks better get used to the pain of being burned by bad loans. Masochist shareholders of bank stocks can relax.


**Maruti Suzuki**: **:’(**

Delhi’s odd-even rule has drawn a lot of flak from residents who are being forced to take the bus every other day and smell the smells of the people on the bus. Among those unhappy has to be Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest car maker. Maruti’s results for the first quarter of 2016 [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/live-maruti-suzuki-q4-results-fy16-net-profit-sales-revenue-margins/243113/) a 12% decline in profits. Interestingly, the company cites the Jat reservation agitation as one of the reasons for a fall in profits. But there are also people who are happy with the odd-even rule. Like a 13-year old boy who registered the domain odd-even.com and [sold](http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Remember-The-13YearOld-Who-Created-The-OddEven-Website-Has-Now-Sold-It-To-Orahi/) it to carpooling app, Orahi and now attends advisory board meetings at Orahi as a technical expert, presumably right after watching Chota Bheem. Sticking to the theme, chalk this one up as win for the militant environmentalists - Mahindra is planning to [build](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-mahindra-to-build-indias-first-automobile-shredding-plant-2016-4) India’s first automobile shredding plant that will focus on destroying 100,000 units of old cars, ships and machines per year. They should upload videos of machines crushing cars to YouTube.

**Let’s Pretend Like This Is A Creative Title**

Every time there’s technological progress, people piss themselves silly telling everyone that machines will take all our jobs now. That has been happening since the past decade or so and likely started when they invented swords to replace the jobs of all the people who made pointy sticks. But today, there is a special kind of irony when the engineers who make machines and software that replace other people’s jobs start getting replaced by software and machines themselves. One of Infosys’ co-founders says growth in hiring has [decreased](http://www.businessinsider.in/Heres-why-automation-AI-is-good-news-for-IT-companies-and-bad-news-for-you/articleshow/52037635.cms) by 40% over the past 10 years and will likely fall further. And it’s all happening because of automation in the IT industry. There’s only one job available for every five engineers graduating every year. Psh, and they said arts students don’t get jobs. Due to this increased supply and reduced demand, salaries for new hires [stayed](http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/no-salary-hike-for-freshers-in-it-space-amid-hiring-blues/52019188) pretty much the same despite a booming IT industry. Indians who opted for the road less traveled despite family pressure to pursue engineering cannot stop smiling right now.

**Last Week In Vijay Mallya’s Life**

Not to jump on the bandwagon of hating him because it’s cool now, but that Mallya fellow just can’t stay out of the news media, try as he might. Either that or the news media just can’t stay out of Mallya’s life, and they don’t even try. Brands confiscated by the banks a few weeks ago like ‘Fly the Good Times’ and ‘Fly Kingfisher’ were [put](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/logistics/lenders-begin-auction-of-brand-kingfisher-trademarks/article8540946.ece) on auction for the second time. And for the second time, nobody was stupid enough to make a bid. The minimum price was set at ₹367 crore. It’s safe to say - those brands are poisonous by now. The Supreme Court [directed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-directs-vijay-mallya-to-furnish-details-of-assets-in-india-abroad/) Mallya to declare all his foreign and domestic assets to the banks so they can be better prepared at the negotiations table. Mallya isn’t back in the news. He just never left the news. They also just [revoked](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/india-revokes-passport-of-vijay-mallya-who-fled-to-london-owing-13bn) his passport - and being an MP, he’s even got one of those shiny red diplomatic passports, which is now useless. That last sentence was written before news broke that Mallya had [resigned](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vijay-mallya-resigns-from-rajya-sabha/article8547747.ece) from the Rajya Sabha -  so now that shiny red diplomatic passport is really useless.

**Bros Again: Reliance and Iran**

The Iranian Revolution of 1979 overthrew the ruling dynasty in Iran which was supported by the US. Since this was a matter of internal politics in a sovereign country outside the US territory, the US had to respond, as is tradition - and it promptly imposed economic sanctions, which were recently lifted. Reliance, which has substantial investments in the US, had suspended trade with Iran for fears of being dragged through the mud in the US. But last week, Reliance [resumed](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reliance-buys-iranian-oil-after-6-year-hiatus_6377461.html) buying oil from Iran after almost 6 years. Talking about oil - oil prices have crashed the floor and everyone’s predicting the end of Saudi Arabia as we know it. There was even talk about an IPO for Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, to raise cash and douse the fire lit by falling oil prices. If there is a fire, the kingdom is trying to hide the smoke. Saudi Aramco is now actually looking to [expand](http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-top-story/saudi-aramco-mulling-offers-for-indian-oil-refinery-stakes-pradhan-116042600203_1.html) and buy stakes in Indian petrochemical projects, possibly in a planned oil refinery on the west coast.

*“We will not allow a repeat of Kingfisher”* - Ashok Raju, Civil Aviation Minister, commenting on the airliner that collapsed under the weight of ₹9,000 crore of debt. Except we already have another Kingfisher. With a debt-burden of over ₹51,000 crore, we just call it Air India.

###Headline Stories

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports. Last week, the duty which was set to expire this month was [renewed](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/180616/india-extends-25-percent-tax-on-wheat-imports-ram-vilas-paswan.html) for 3 more months. But it might not work as planned. Despite being the world’s 2nd largest producer of wheat, Indian imports of wheat could touch a decade-high this year. Well, at least the government will make a ton of cash off it.

* Technically, Amazon India is not an e-commerce company. It is an online marketplace [that](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/amazon-continues-to-lobby-for-hybrid-ecommerce-model-in-india-116061300365_1.html) connects buyers and sellers. E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce. One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing. Can you guess which industry didn’t make the cut?

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

###Footnote Stories

They say there aren’t any free lunches in the world. But at least you don’t get the bill after a free lunch. However, that might soon change. Due to some ambiguity in the GST bill as it stands right now, you could [potentially](http://www.businessinsider.in/Nothing-is-going-to-come-for-free-after-GST-is-implemented-Heres-why/articleshow/52775662.cms) end up paying taxes on things that you get for free. While it is highly unlikely that this goes through, this could spell the end of all those ‘Buy One, Get One Free’ offers that businesses use to kill two birds with one stone - get some solid goodwill with consumers, and get rid of old merchandise.

For a lot of Indians, the festival that brings families and friends together is no longer Diwali. It’s the festival of IPL. The sporting franchise recently concluded its 9th season this year. And it [raked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-is-a-money-spinner-as-it-amasses-rs-2500-crore-in-its-ninth-season/articleshow/52720049.cms) in ₹2,500 crore in overall revenue from advertising, sponsorships, ticket sales and merchandising. A big chunk of that money, as much as ₹1,100 crore went to Sony as the official broadcaster of the IPL. With that kind of cash, it doesn’t matter which team you support or which team wins, the executives at Sony always win.

I joined my family business of loose diamonds. I realized I do not enjoy selling diamonds. I want to move to India. I have a BBA in Finance. Should I move to work in India (preferrably Mumbai)? I understand finding a job will be very tough, and the starting salary will be peanuts, but hopefully I can move up the ladder with hardwork. My dad will not support me financially and I do not have much savings. As it is, I do not make much currently, as Im not passionate about what I do. Also, I would love to settle down in India in the future. 

Should I move to India? Or things are not as rosy and easy as I assume them to be? Any advice is appreciated. Are the career opportunities good? Is BBA in Finance enough to get me my first job? 

I am also planning to self-teach web development and move to India mid next year. Currently, I am 22 years old.

Note: Finding a job in Thailand for a non-Thai citizen is very tough. Also, I have posted about my situation here before but for a different advice.",6

**Return Of The Avengers**

Whoever says Hollywood’s superhero movies are unrealistic? The Avengers are actually real. Hollywood’s Avengers was a group of superheroes saving the universe by blowing stuff up. In reality, the Avengers are a group of guys that just blow stuff up for no real reason. The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has been [blowing](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/oil-hovers-near-8-month-highs-on-us-inventory-draw.html) up oil wells in Nigeria and has rejected any peace talks with the government. After dropping to dangerous lows of $20, crude oil prices have bounced back and recently crossed the $50 mark. Much of the reason for this rise is simply the forces of supply and demand reacting to each other in a free market. But one of the reasons it touched $50 last week was the Avengers sabotaging oil wells. A lot of investors betting on the resurgence of oil can’t say this out loud, but thank god for terrorist Avengers. However, not everybody is celebrating the return of oil. In the latest policy review, the RBI (which kept interest rates untouched last week), [cited](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/black-gold-a-headache-not-only-for-modi-but-for-raghuram-rajan-too/articleshow/52634156.cms) rising oil prices as a risk. Because when oil prices go up, inflation goes up as well. Personally, I’m just sad that budget cuts forced the Avengers to opt for simple dynamite instead of nuclear-powered Mach-5 flying suits.

**Black Problems**

India has a huge second economy that deals with black money. That’s news to nobody. But a new study has [pegged](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/new-study-pegs-black-money-in-india-at-rs-30-lakh-crore/story/233395.html) the size of that black economy at an astounding 20% of GDP or over ₹30 lakh crore (that’s 3 followed by 13 zeroes). And that just happens to be bigger than the overall economic size of countries like Thailand or Argentina. While the size of India’s black economy expanded rapidly during the 70s and 80s, it has been gradually declining since then. Today, most of this money is locked up in physical assets like real estate or gold. Due to obvious reasons, there are no official figures but experts say that as much as 30% of India’s real estate sector is funded by black money. Really, only in economics can you root for the supremacy of white over black and not be called a ~~Donald Trump supporter~~ racist.

**The Curious Case Of Missing GDP**

How does a 7.9% growth in GDP sound to you? If you ask the average joe on the streets, he won’t know what is what. But if you ask the fairly well-read joe on the streets, he’ll tell you that a 7.9% growth rate is amazing. But what about a 3.9% growth in GDP? Now, that’s bad. Official numbers released last week say that India’s GDP in the March quarter grew by 7.9%. But wait, there’s more. The accuracy of those numbers has been [called](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kvvDHfbryOQjvu2l16UcEI/Discrepancies-drive-GDP-growth.html) into question. When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. As long as this discrepancy doesn’t get too big, all is well. But the amount of discrepancy in the latest numbers has shot up by over 350%. And if you remove the amount put under ‘discrepancy’, GDP growth rate falls from 7.9% to 3.9%. Faking GDP numbers? Come on guys, that’s not our job. That’s China’s [job](http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/china-fake-economic-data/).


**Economic Story Because Export and Import**

Nuclear weapons are serious business. Emphasis on serious rather than business. Although a handful of companies do make money off the nuclear power business. When sensitive nuclear technology falls in the wrong hands, you have rogue nations like North Korea and when it falls in the right hands... well, there really aren’t any right hands for nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 48-countries that controls the export and import of goods that can be used to make a nuclear weapon. The NSG does this to ensure that nuclear technology doesn’t fall in the wrong hands. But India is not one of its 48 members. One of the reasons we are not invited to parties thrown by the NSG is because we have nuclear weapons but haven’t signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is an international agreement designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is a sore point with a lot of countries like China who are against India joining the NSG. However, being being friends with the United States, the world’s superpower does come with a lot of benefits. A US-led push to include India in the NSG is [picking](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear-idUSKCN0YV13Z) up steam as nations like South Africa and Turkey are coming around to supporting India’s bid for a membership. Here’s the irony - the only reason the NSG even exists as an international group, is because India tested nuclear weapons in the 70s and that rustled some jimmies in the international community.

* Government offices spend around 10-20% of non-plan expenditure or roughly 1.4 lakh crore on routine office purchases like cups and saucers to laptops and printers. And the government’s purchasing arm is [considering](http://www.businessinsider.in/Government-e-Marketplace/articleshow/52652285.cms) a portal called GeM (Government e-Marketplace) that’ll let employees buy routine office purchases online. Basically, they’re making a clone of Flipkart. Because you know, using Flipkart is just too mainstream now.

* The Tata Group of companies is a big group of companies. They’ve got companies tucked away in every nook and cranny of the economy - a total of close to 100 companies, of which only 30 companies are listed on the stock exchange. That number is set to become 31, as the group [revived](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/tata-technologies-revives-ipo-plan-likely-to-raise-rs-1400-crore/articleshow/52664433.cms) plans of an IPO for Tata Technologies, the engineering and IT arm of Tata Motors. If this goes through, it’ll also be the first IPO from the Tata Group in 12 years after TCS in 2004.

* The US-India Business Council counts the big boys of the global industry like Boeing, PepsiCo, MasterCard and many more as its members. And collectively, these big boys are [investing](http://www.firstpost.com/world/modi-terms-india-new-engine-of-growth-usibc-sees-45-bn-investment-2822448.html) a total of $45 billion on expanding operations in India. It’s not just one big cheque, they’ll invest over a few years. Amazon, a member of the Council as well as a big boy, committed to investing an extra $3 billion in addition to $2 billion already invested in Amazon India. The $5 billion funding will take Amazon India past the combined funding raised by both local rivals, Flipkart and Snapdeal. 

* A hot, young investment banker in London just bought a new Jaguar Land Rover car nicknamed the ‘baby Jag’ in all cash upfront. A trucker in Uttar Pradesh just scraped together enough money to buy a light Tata truck hoping that ferrying cargo from city to city will pay for his son’s education. What do those two people have in common? They both [contributed](http://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/domestic-turnaround-jlr-boost-tata-motors-net-profit-three-fold/941818) to the tripling of profit for the March quarter at Tata Motors to ₹5,177 crore.

###Footnote Stories
***
Earlier this year, the Indian government once again tried to get the famed Kohinoor diamond back from the UK and failed. Citing that it would set an “unworkable precedent”, UK Prime Minister David Cameron [refused](http://www.newsweek.com/kohinoor-diamond-india-colonialism-449951) to return the stone, which has been claimed by the governments of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan at various points as well. That didn’t pan out quite well. But how do 200 statues and sculptures sound instead of 1 big fat diamond? The US  is [returning](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/07/us/stolen-artifacts-returned-india/) more than 200 artifacts that were stolen and smuggled out and eventually just ended up in the hands of the US government. Some of them are as old as 2,000 years and are worth over $100 million.

The government has, for the first time in history, [declared](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/03/india-will-have-surplus-power-for-the-first-time-ever-report) that it will not have a shortage of electricity this year. Baring the small matter of authorities often choosing to black out certain areas to hide demand, from June onwards, the country will have more electricity than required. Psh. Power cut. Shmower Cut.

**The Rain Gods Want Beer And IPL**

Maharashtra is suffering from a major drought, which is a big deal because hospitals in the severely hit areas have had to cancel operations due to water shortages. It’s so bad that SS* President Uddhav Thackeray has [asked](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/maharashtra-drought-water-crisis-latur-govt-should-stop-water-supply-to-beer-units-in-view-of-drought-shiv-sena-chief-2756485/) the government to stop supplying water to breweries in the state. There’s more. The Mumbai High Court has also [ordered](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36038026) 13 IPL Cricket matches to move out of the state (cricket matches use up a ton of water). You know it’s bad when they go after cricket and beer. The rain gods got a wind of what was happening and have decided to stop the madness before riots break out. The Indian Meteorological Department, which predicts rainfalls among other things, has [predicted](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Economy-set-for-boost-as-Met-forecasts-above-normal-monsoon/articleshow/51802516.cms) “above normal” rainfall this year that may break the two-year long drought and help revive a weak farm economy. Take it with a grain of salt since these are only predictions but they have been supported by two private forecasters as well.

*Shiv Sena, not the Nazis.

**Some Good Numbers**

Several agencies just unloaded a big data dump and while the data isn’t always good, this time it is. Consumer Price Inflation [slowed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-price-inflation-slows/article8467622.ece) to 4.83% in March, the lowest it has been in 6 months. The price declines were led by the ‘food and beverage’ segment. Who doesn’t love cheap food? Industrial Output broke a 3-month negative streak to grow by 2% in February while electricity production grew by 10% in the same month. All those foreign tours are paying off - despite a decrease from 2014 numbers, recent numbers show India as the world’s largest remittance recipient in 2015 after NRIs [sent](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-is-top-remittance-recipient-of-2015-World-Bank/articleshow/51822766.cms) back $69 billion (₹459,988 crore) to families in India. Economists around the country are calling it the “Karan Johar effect”. But that also works the other way around - outward remittances from India grew by over 300% to reach $499 million (₹3,326 crore). Although bank deposits grew by 10%, it’s the slowest growth rate since 1963. But that could also indicate increased consumer spending which can be good for the economy - depends on if you’re a glass half-full or half-empty kind of person.

**No Smoking - Part 2**

Part 1 Recap: The size of the pictorial health warnings that go over cigarette packets was increased from 20% to 85%. Confusion over the decision prompted cigarette manufacturers including ITC ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC)) to shut down all cigarette factories in protest. And now…

Part 2: Turns out - all that drama was over nothing. Cigarette manufacturers, having realized that the government can stay adamant longer than they can stay in business, have decided to [resume](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/itc-to-resume-cigarette-manufacturing/story/231126.html) cigarette manufacturing. But that doesn’t mean the end of this saga. While the mainstream cigarette brands have resumed production, now the traditional cigarette makers that make *beedis*, have [shut](http://in.reuters.com/article/tobacco-industry-supreme-court-appeal-idINKCN0XB1H6) down production because the “wrapping paper edges prevent printing on a reasonably large area of the curved surface”. The beedi industry employs more than 8.8 million Indians mostly in rural impoverished areas, who might be temporarily out of a job. A lawsuit challenging the size increase has already made its way to the Supreme Court which is set to hear the case on April 22nd.

Stay tuned for Part 3 - Coming Soon.

**TCS’s US Troubles**

A grand jury in the United States has [held](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-denies-ip-infringement-will-appeal-940-million-jury-award-in-us-trade-secrets-theft-case/articleshow/51855594.cms) Tata Consultancy Services ([TCS](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATCS)) in violation of copyright and intellectual property laws and asked the company to pay a fine of $940 million (₹6,266 crore). In October 2014, Epic Systems, an American healthcare software provider, filed a lawsuit accusing TCS of stealing trade secrets, confidential information and more than 6,000 secret documents in order to improve its own competing product called ‘Med Mantra’. And now, the jury has found that TCS did indeed do all those things. TCS, part of the Tata Group known for its integrity and ethics, has denied all allegations. Cheap ripoffs of Western products and brands is usually China’s ball game. But hey, if it works, why not? Except this time, it turned out to be not so cheap - $940 million is close to half of Epic Systems annual revenue.

**Greybull Capital To The Rescue!**

Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL)), after a year of intensive searching has found a scapegoat that’s willing to buy a part of its loss-making UK operations. The company is [selling](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/tatas-sell-uk-unit-to-greybull-for-1/235275/) a part of its failing business in the UK to private equity investor Greybull Capital (not to be confused with Red Bull, provider of wings). You don’t really understand the extent to which the Tatas were desperate until you hear that the UK business was sold for just a nominal sum of £1 (94 rupees) and the current pension obligations for employees will still stay with the Tatas. The search for buyers for the remaining parts of the business is still on. However, this has not scared the company off Europe in any way. Tata Steel was [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tata-steel-thyssenkrupp-idINKCN0XA0F0) to be in talks with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (thi-sen-krup) to merge their European businesses under a joint venture.

**Last Week On Rajan Watch**

Last year, PM Modi called RBI Governor Rajan as the “best teacher” for explaining complex economic issues to him. Days later, Rajan said the teaching went both ways. Aww. But the bromance doesn’t end there. Reports saying the PM is “proud” of Rajan surfaced last week [stating](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rajan-insight-idUSKCN0YM2SC) that any campaign against Rajan will not affect the big decision that he needs to make on Rajan’s reappointment. That might’ve been a snide reference to MP Subramanian Swamy’s moves to remove Rajan, Swamy has even rebuked Rajan for “speaking like a grandfather” (what? with artificial teeth? I mean Rajan is already 53, while Swamy is 76). Being best buds with Modi will definitely help Rajan secure his governorship at the RBI for a second term. But then, later in the day, reports [surfaced](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-doesnt-want-extension-media-report/articleshow/52536142.cms) that Rajan doesn’t even want to continue as Governor and would rather be a spectator in the game by going back to teach in the US and continue research on the Indian economy. Apparently, his family has already left. Somebody better buy the rights to this reality show - I’m personally hanging by the edge of my seat. Rajan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the interest rate meeting this week. And the markets are expected to worry more about the “Rexit” - Rajan exiting the RBI than the interest rates this week. 

**Lincoln Could Only Do So Much**

When you have North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Qatar at the top of a list - you pretty much know that the it isn’t the list of world’s happiest countries, it just has to be a list about something bad. Last week, India [shared](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-18-35-million-people-india-tops-global-slavery-index-1413891) a spot on such a list with all of these countries and it was the list that ranks countries in terms of slavery. Yikes. Owning a person might’ve gone out of fashion decades ago, but the trend is still alive - With a global figure of 46 million modern-day slaves, India is home to 18 million of those modern-day slaves followed by 3 million in China and 2 million in Pakistan that are implicated in domestic work, prostitution, manual labour, forced begging and so on. Even in manufacturing, working conditions at factories contribute a lot to the problem by essentially turning employees into slaves. Prominent for workplace [violations](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/01/gap-walmart-factory-workers-exploited-and-abused-in-india) are factories that supply global multinationals like Walmart or Gap. They’ve been known to have working conditions that don’t just border on exploitation - but are miles away from that border, deep into exploitation territory. Complaints include non-payment of wages, forced overtime work, inability to form unions, extreme health consequences that may be fatal due to lack of safety regulations and even sexual harassment. How’s that 9-to-5 desk job sounding now?


**Follow The Money?**

In 2014, between the time when Modi was elected and the time when Modi was sworn-in as the PM, the Sensex was [up](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/narendra-modi-vs-bse-sensex/) 1,685 points. Clearly, the stock market loves Modi. But Modi thinks of the stock market as just a friend. Asset disclosures have [revealed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pm-modi-top-ministers-stay-clear-of-stocks-keep-assets-in-realty-banks/articleshow/52413153.cms) that the PM has 79% of his total assets, which amount to a total of ₹26.1 lakh, in real estate and a big fat 0% in stocks. The stock market was friend-zoned not just by the PM, but by his cabinet as well. While the total assets of the top 9 ministers in the Indian government amounted to a staggering ₹91.1 crore, only 2% of them were invested in the stock market. The richest of the bunch was Arun Jaitley, perhaps appropriately the Finance Minister, who has total assets of ₹49.5 crore, a significant portion of which is just cold hard cash sitting as bank deposits. The poorest of the bunch was Suresh Prabhu, perhaps also appropriately the Railway Minister, who has total assets of mere ₹17 lakh. You want to talk about the gap between the rich and the poor? We’ve got that gap right here for you in government’s *navratnas*. 

**Time for Tim: Cook’s India Aftermath**

Tim came, Tim saw but Tim did not conquer. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, visited India a few weeks ago to much media fanfare and met several top government ministers. But to Tim’s disappointment, he failed to convince anyone to allow Apple to launch its famous retail iStores in India. Currently, Apple sells products through a network of dealers. That’s because under current regulations, if Apple wants to open retail stores, it needs to source 30% of content locally. Sourcing 30% locally means Apple would have to start manufacturing in India. Either that, or just buy stuff from local businesses and literally light it on fire. Neither of those things is about to happen. However, under current regulations, Apple can be granted a waiver to the 30% rule but only if Apple is bringing “cutting-edge” technology to India. And in the classic bureaucratic fashion, nobody actually bothered to define what “cutting-edge” would mean. And when you leave crucial terms like that open for interpretation, somewhere somehow a lawyer gets all excited. Now, Apple fanboys might disagree on this but government officials are unlikely to call any of Apple’s technology “cutting-edge” and are widely [expected](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lDn53REhqvhqGoIxs9MgwJ/Apples-proposal-to-sell-refurbished-iPhones-in-India-reject.html) to decline Apple’s petition for a waiver of the 30% rule. The government is also not a big fan of Apple’s proposal to sell second-hand iPhones in India fearing that the country would become a graveyard for all old iPhones.

* Startups always describe themselves as the Google of this, or the Facebook of that, to the point that it’s become one of the annoying buzzwords of the startup world.

**Banks - Mo’ Money, No Problems**

Two major private sector banks, Axis and HDFC, reported results for the quarter ending June and it’s a mixed bag. The bad loans crisis [continued](http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/axis-bank-q1-results-net-profit-bad-loans-on-july-22-2016/325755/) to hit Axis Bank where profits fell by 21%. But HDFC Bank, which mostly focuses on retail borrowers, [managed](http://in.reuters.com/article/hdfc-bank-results-idINKCN1010ML) to entirely miss the crisis as profits were up by 20%. However, the bag isn’t so mixed when it comes to public sector banks which are riddled with problems. The government’s got 99 problems, and 98 of them probably involve the banking sector in one way or another. Now, one way to solve problems is to just throw money at the problem. And 13 public sector banks just [received](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-allocates-rs-22915-cr-for-psu-bank-re-capitalization_7065221.html) about ₹22,915 crore of cash from the government. A back of the envelope calculation says if they had delivered all that cash physically, it would weigh about 275 kgs. Yes, I did the math. After reserving a lot of money to treat the bad loans problem, the banks didn’t have much remaining to lend out to borrowers. And if banks stop lending money, the entire economy grinds to a halt. So the new capital given by the government is supposed to help them get back into the lending game again. The largest recipient of this capital infusion was our largest bank, the State Bank of India that got about ₹7,575 crore. However, this is only a “capital infusion” and definitely not a “bailout”. Who even said bailout? There’s no bailout here. What bailout?

**ELI5 - GST**

GST - You know it’s a thing. But you don’t have a single clue what it’s about. The only time you hear about it is while changing channels on the TV. And from your drunk uncle at wedding receptions who thinks he’s an expert in politics. The Goods and Services Tax is probably the most important tax reform of this decade. It replaces a whole bunch of indirect taxes such as the VAT, Service Tax or Excise Duty. So instead of paying ten taxes at ten places, you only pay one tax at one place. And cutting down on that paperwork starts a domino effect of good things for the economy. At least that’s the theory. But the bill has been stuck in Rajya Sabha for a long time now. So what’s the big hold up? Political parties have been negotiating the finer details of the bill and the negotiations are taking a little more time than everybody expected. Some sore points of disagreement are whether to place a maximum limit of 18% above which the GST tax rate cannot be raised, whether to levy a 1% surcharge on interstate trade and how to resolve any disputes in the process. But now, if you feel like you aren’t getting enough of our beloved parliamentarians that are so hard at work solving our problems in penthouses all around Delhi, then fear no more. Because the government is [planning](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/gst-hopes-brighten-as-congress-signals-support-bjp-ready-for-debate-in-rajya-sabha_1908866.html) a 5-hour-long debate in the Rajya Sabha aiming to resolve all disputes and pass the bill once and for all. That’s right, back to back five hours of bickering old men in white clothes - without any commercial breaks.

**Tesla to go desi?**

The pollution in Delhi has reached such an alarming level that if a Delhi resident starts smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and garnishing his food with powered nicotine while sleeping in a chamber full of passive tobacco smoke, he’ll probably still die of asthma from the polluted air before the lung cancer gets to him. And then there’s Delhi CM Mr. Kejriwal who recently hinted at the possibility of the torturous odd-even rule returning back to Delhi during the upcoming winters to curb pollution. What the city clearly needs is a whole bunch of emission-free electric cars. And accordingly, the government’s making moves to get Tesla, the car company famous for its electric cars to come to India. Apart from offering to promote joint ventures between Tesla and Indian car companies, the government is even [offering](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tesla-and-make-in-india-a-roadway-to-cleaner-and-greener-india-but-how-soon-326205.html) Tesla land near major ports so it can Make in India and export to other Asian countries as well. However, the pipe dream of driving a Tesla down the national highways is unlikely to come true for at least a few years. Until then, we’ve got to find other ways to reduce pollution. Such as banning all diesel vehicles older than 10 years, which is what the National Green Tribunal just did. NGT, a top environmental court, has [directed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-autos-court-idUSKCN0ZY12P) Delhi transport authorities to de-register any diesel vehicles older than 10 years, and car companies couldn’t be happier.

~~**Tollywoodonomics**~~  **Kollywoodonomics**

Rajinikanth, the Amitabh Bachchan of the South, was out with his latest movie *Kabali*, which opened last Friday in 6,500 theaters, many of which were sold out for the entire weekend. In the movie industry, you’re only as good as your last flop - and in Rajini’s case, his last movie was *Lingaa* and before that, *Kochadaiiyaan* - both of which - well, let's just say that they haven’t exactly been Spielberg material. So you’d think producers would think twice before betting on this next film - but this Rajini we are talking about. He doesn’t follow the laws of economics. The laws of economics follow Ra... okay, yeah, those jokes stopped being funny 10 years ago. But still, people literally pour milk on huge cutouts of this guy. So producers went all in and funded Kabali with a budget of ₹110 crore. Here’s the kicker - the movie had already [earned](http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/how-rajinikanths-kabali-has-earned-rs-200-crore-days-before-its-release-2902140.html) ₹200 crore even before being released. Music rights, overseas rights, satellite rights and all other kinds of rights had already earned the movie a ton of cash before being released. How much did Rajini make off the movie? The actor was reportedly [paid](http://www.catchnews.com/regional-cinema/revealed-this-is-how-much-rajinikanth-charged-for-kabali-movie-news-rajinikanth-kabali-fees-revealed-1469024603.html) ₹35 crore as acting fees plus he’s set to receive another ₹45 crore from first week collections of the movie at the box office. Rajini being Rajini, theaters were sold out but prices for tickets in black ranged up to ₹1,500 with reports saying fans were ready to pay as much as ₹5,000 for tickets. All of this only points to one thing - at 65-years old, Rajini’s still got some swag.

However, mobile internet packs have stood the test of drought to become best-sellers across rural India. Which, I believe, can be taken as conclusive evidence that even farmers in far-reaching corners of rural India love browsing aww-worthy cat photos on the internet. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the hardest hit company, is wiping its tears of sadness with the $1.4 billion it earned in profits just last quarter.

High inflation is one of the worst things that can happen to the Indian middle class. As in the type of middle class that earns way less than ₹1.6 lakhs per month. There’s food inflation, price inflation, fuel inflation, netflix is raising prices.. And now, there’s pocket money inflation. A 29-city survey of nearly 7,000 kids aged between 4 to 14 and their parents [reveals](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/spend/kids-pocket-money-up-100-since-2012-turner-international-india-study/articleshow/53238075.cms) that the average pocket money given to kids has shot up by 100% since 2012, and currently stands at ₹555 per month.

The temple receives about ₹75 crore of donations in cash and kind annually, which is entirely tax-free.

**Big Oil To Get Fatter**

One of the ideas being thrown around to deal with the bad loans crisis was merging all 27 state-owned banks to make 6 really huge banks. Taking inspiration from that idea, the government is now throwing around another idea - [merging](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-set-to-start-talks-on-merging-13-state-oil-companies-to-create-behemoth/articleshow/53371857.cms) 13 big state-owned oil companies to make 1 really huge oil company. Companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lead the list of the 13 companies being considered for this mega-merger. Even as oil prices nearly committed suicide last year, just the top 6 state-owned oil companies still managed to report revenues of ₹9.3 trillions. So clearly, the 1 giant oil company that will come out of these mergers will be big enough to rival the likes of UK’s BP and Russia’s Rosneft. But it will still be a few ranks smaller than some of the biggest oil companies in the world. And at least when it comes to business, size does matter. This idea of merging oil companies isn’t a new idea - it’s been brought up and shot down numerous times in the past mainly due to concerns over reduced competition. Mergers are extra difficult for government companies because after every merger, there’s some extra fat that you have to trim. But government companies tend to focus on social welfare before profit - which means keeping that extra fat to pump up employment in the country. Even if the prospect of this 1 giant oil company with trillions in revenue seems huge right now, rest assured, it won’t be bigger than *yo mama*.

**Gone Are The Days Of Jabong**

The e-commerce industry made multiple headlines last week - the biggest story being the acquisition of Jabong. Flipkart-owned Myntra went shopping around for companies and [dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/rocket-internets-jabong-sold-to-flipkart-owned-rival-myntra-for-70m/) $70 million on Jabong, creating the largest online fashion company. The second-highest bidder for Jabong was Snapdeal which offered $50 million followed by Future Group (that owns the Big Bazaar stores) which offered $35 million. It’s been a tough couple of years for Jabong. Even Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of the e-commerce business, briefly considered acquiring Jabong for $1 billion back in 2014. Compared to that price tag, Flipkart got a nice discount of 93%. However, the days aren’t as rosy as they sound for Flipkart. Exhibit A - the company just [fired](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/start-ups/article-flipkart-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-underperforming-employees-report-1437780) about 700 employees and tried to play it off as “a fairly common practice”. Exhibit B - Industry reports released last week indicate that Amazon has [surpassed](http://www.firstpost.com/business/most-consumers-preferred-amazon-over-flipkart-for-online-transactions-in-2016-says-survey-2915798.html) Flipkart to become India’s preferred online destination. Exhibit C - Snapdeal reached 1 million daily transacting users, more than those of Flipkart and Amazon put together. Seems like bad news does come in threes.

**RIO MMXVI**

The 2016 Olympic Games are set to begin next week in Brazil. As the media begins extensive coverage of the events, get ready for the millions of Indians that will be shocked to find out about the existence of sports other than cricket and fighting trolls online. Just as the international media came at India with pitchforks drawn for botching up the 2010 Commonwealth Games, let’s turn those pitchforks around and poke other countries for mismanaging international sporting events. The host nation, Brazil is going through its worst economic crisis since 1930 and its worst health crisis since 1918. The country’s GDP contracted by 4% in 2015, and is expected to [contract](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-02-22/budget-rio-olympics-16-times-higher-budget-combat-zika-virus) by another 3% in 2016. Plus there’s the small matter of Zika viruses roaming around giving birth defects to unborn babies. Technically, the country doesn’t have a President since the most recent one was suspended under charges of corruption. Considering all of that, just the fact that Brazil hasn’t descended into anarchy is an achievement. The government has allocated $9.7 billion for the Olympic Games, which is 16 times more than the budget allocated to deal with the Zika virus that has already infected 1.5 million Brazilians. Hashtag Priorities. However, every Olympic Game since 1968 has exceeded its budget by an average of 179% which means that $9.7 billion could very well balloon up to $17 billion. Godspeed Brazil, godspeed.

**News Flash: Old Age Is Tough**

Most people’s idea of preparing for retirement includes investing in 1) Fixed Deposits, 2) Mutual Funds or 3) A kid or two. But a survey by the investment bank HSBC [found](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/47-indians-not-saving-for-retirement-hsbc_1908299.html) that 47% of the working people in India haven’t even started saving for retirement. No need to panic - the global average is around the same at 46% - so the rest of the world is as deep in this swamp as India. The HSBC survey also found the 80% of Indians seek advice about retirement from friends and family - which basically means that your primary source of information about retirement is that one balding uncle you have who walks around with a beer belly and midlife crisis. That’s just one survey. Here’s another - the annual Global Retirement Index published by Natixis, one of the biggest asset management companies in France, [ranked](http://qz.com/737382/india-is-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-retire-2/) India as the 43rd best country to retire. That doesn’t seem so bad until you realize that the Index only tracks 43 countries to begin with, and India finished last. Dispelling any notions that India finished last due to all the nice guys in the country, the index mentioned the pitiful state of India’s healthcare system as one of the reasons that we finished last. Meanwhile, Norway and Switzerland were ranked as the best places to retire.

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

Leading bitcoin exchange, Bitfinex, was [hacked](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-bitfinex-hacked-idINKCN10F02Y) last week and cryptocurrency worth $70 million was stolen. The exchange has announced a plan to compensate all customers. In other words, business as usual for bitcoin.

Moon Express, a US-based company co-founded by Indian-origin entrepreneur Naveen Jain, [became](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/moon-express-becomes-first-private-company-to-receive-permission-to-go-to-the-moon/) the first ever private company to receive permission from the US government for a commercial space mission to the moon. The company’s business plan involves accepting sponsorships and carrying private payloads to the moon in order to make a profit. In future space missions, the company expects to make money by mining for natural resources on moon, specifically mining for Helium-3. This would’ve happened a lot sooner if only the moon had some oil. Helium-3 is all fine... But it’s no oil.

**7th Pay Commission**

If entrepreneurship is where ambitions get fulfilled, a 9-to-5 bureaucratic government desk job is where ambitions get killed. A government job is an excellent way to start your career, if what you want is to also end your career in a government job because once you’re in there, you really need to screw up big time to be thrown out. How big? You could even skip work for 24 years before being fired like [this](https://www.rt.com/news/221543-india-government-employee-fired/) guy. Along with the literally fire-proof long-term job security, there’s also the chance of making a little buck from time to time with bribes - although few will admit it. But the jobs do come with the downside of being low paid. And the government is working to change that. Every ten years since independence, the government appoints a “pay commission” that recommends what to change in the salaries of over 1 crore government employees and pensioners. The government recently accepted the recommendations of the 7th and the latest pay commission which include an average pay hike of about 24%. It [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/7th-pay-commission-salary-hike-govt-salary-hike-arun-jaitley-2886723/) spending an additional ₹1 lakh crore (that’s 1 followed by 12 zeros) annually to accommodate increased salaries and pensions. Some of the money will presumably go right back into government coffers through taxes. But a range of other issues have stuck out as thorns and lakhs of government employees have threatened to go on strike if they remain unresolved.

**The Banks Need A Stress Ball**

It's been a long, long time since the RBI’s crusade against bad loans in the banking system started. But it doesn’t show any signs of stopping in the near future as the situation has only deteriorated. And if things continue going downhill, banks like the Bank of Maharashtra will probably have to switch slogans from ‘One Family One Bank’ to ‘One Bank One Bankruptcy’. The most recent round of stress tests at the RBI indicate that the banks are in desperate need of a vacation to de-stress for a little bit. The central bank [warned](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/stability-of-banks-has-worsened-significantly/article8784540.ece) that stability in the banking system has significantly worsened since mid-2010s. There is no use praying for the speedy recovery of our banking system as even the RBI did not exactly sound optimistic. At minimum, the central bank expects the amount of bad loans to rise from 7.6% this year to 8.5% next year. And at maximum, that figure can reach 9.3%. Profitability at the banks is in the dumps, having gone [down](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/takeaways-from-rbis-stress-test-banks-very-close-to-tipping-point/articleshow/52967108.cms) by 43% due to write-offs. Looking back at this mess, you can’t help but wonder what will happen if the banking crisis hits a tipping point, if the Punjab National Bank goes from ‘The Name You Can Bank Upon’ to ‘The Name That Just Went Bankrupt’.

**One Giant Leap for ISRO**

Every time ISRO makes news with a launch, you get that occasional story in your social feed that you like without reading and feel proud for about an hour, space exploration replaces Salman Khan on the list of things people care about, #ISRO trends on twitter, NRIs get that occasional feeling of guilt over contributing to brain drain and Shahrukh Khan is relevant because Swades. Well, here’s the story that you might’ve already seen and liked without reading: last week, ISRO made news in the global space commerce industry by [launching](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-throws-satellite-making-open-to-private-sector-1423043) 20 satellites in one rocket. 17 of the 20 satellites were from foreign customers of Antrix, the commercial arm of ISRO.  It’s really anyone’s guess how much Antrix or ISRO charges for one satellite launch, but Antrix did report revenues of over ₹1,800 crore in 2015. But the launch wasn’t the only ISRO event making news. AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of ISRO invited the private sector to make a full spacecraft. So far, private companies like Larsen & Toubro or Godrej Aerospace have only manufactured the components that go into the making of a satellite.

**Time To Go Public**

India has two stock exchanges that really matter - the NSE and the BSE. So if those two companies wish to go public and list on the stock market, they’ve got two options to begin with. One, list shares on the rival stock exchange and risk being regulated by a competitor. Or two, list shares on it’s own stock exchange which is prohibited by regulations due to being the most obvious conflict of interest since the makers of sliced bread said it was the best thing ever. While the BSE is already in the process of listing shares and going public, the NSE [entered](http://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/nse-plans-to-file-ipo-document-by-jan-2017/article8779637.ece) the fray last week by announcing plans to go public as well. Interestingly, along with plans to list shares in India, the company also intends to list overseas by April of next year. It’s a fantastic time of the year to go public. Despite the naysayers of Brexit, recent IPOs have [received](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-ipos-idUSL4N19Q22K) a lot attention from investors and the IPO pipeline currently has big names like Vodafone, ICICI Prudential and L&T Infotech.

You just know that at the very least, your name is going to end up on some “special watchlist” at the Income Tax Department.

Here's why India shouldn't adopt the Nordic welfare model,35,2gg76m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2gg76m/heres_why_india_shouldnt_adopt_the_nordic_welfare/,105,1410808354,"DECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORDIC MODEL

Most problems that India face now can be attributed to consequences of Nehruvian socialism that this country has adopted for about 45 years. I am from Kerala and here the Politics cannot be separated from communism and despite being an age old relic, it still refuses to die out.

Since the reforms that was carried out in 1991 most millennial Indians have largely rejected such archaic concepts focusing more on modernity. But in this context a new concept has largely caught the fancy of most new age Indians: The Nordic model. As such in my experience I see more people supporting Nordic model over communism currently in Kerala. 

In this slightly lengthy post, I will try to deconstruct the Nordic model from two angles.

1. Nordic viability in India
2. Efficacy of Nordic model

First a note on Nordic model. Nordic model or Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state. More or less implemented around the mid 60s, this is said to have promoted a sustainable state and economy in these countries. Calls have been made among policy makers in India, with special mention to Nobel prize winning welfare economist Amartya Sen, to implement reforms along the Nordic lines in India

NORDIC VIABILITY IN INDIA

Nordic Socialism: Indian proponents of Nordic model advocate establishing a state along the social democracy lines. But the truth is that Scandinavia isn't really all that socialist. Scandinavian countries have certain socialist characteristics such as high taxes and extensive welfare systems. However, these countries have relatively capitalistic markets. Scandinavian businesses are mostly free from regulation, nationalization and protectionism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank higher than US in in business freedom, monetary freedom, investment freedom, fiscal freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. Norway ranks higher than the US in trade freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. 

Source: http://www.heritage.org/index/explore

The overall point here is that Scandinavian countries have fairly capitalistic business environments. Until India, which has abysmal rankings in all these parameters, achieve free business environment and comparable income levels it should not consider a comparable welfare model.

 Economic calculation problem: First proposed by Ludwig von Mises, it describes the signalling function of prices. Prices of goods are signals to entrepreneurs to adequately allocate their resources. When economic planning is added to the mix, it distorts the market forces and prices. This in turn facilitates inefficient allocation of resources and wastage. In a macro scale this presents itself as inflation. Larger the economy, harder it becomes to ""plan"". Scandinavian nations are all small economies with homogeneous economic components and it would be relatively easier to centralize function there (But it has not been without its demerits, more on that below). India is one of the largest and the most diverse economy in the world in terms of the economic components involved. As such India is last candidate for any sort of planning. History has shown that most planning here has met with some sort of counterproductive unintended consequence and the inflation numbers here speaks for itself.

Bureaucracy and social trust: Scandinavian countries are characterized by high levels of social liberalism and trust. Research finds that high levels of social trust increase economic growth. According to one study, ""The size of the effect in most studies is such that 10 percentage points higher trust is associated with half a percentage point higher annual growth rate. In the Scandinavian countries, about 60 percent agree that most people can be trusted, which can be compared to the OECD average of about just 40 percent.

Source: http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Govt-Size-and-Growth.pdf

There is also the case of the highly transparent nature of the bureaucracy in the Scandinavian nations. As with the trust worthy nature of the bureaucrats there, they can be trusted with governing functions of the state. Bureaucracy is India on the other hand is an absolute mess. India features almost at the bottom of the transparency index. As evidenced by the corruption, Bureaucrats here simply cannot be trusted with any action and would be best left free of bureaucratic control.

Source: http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/#myAnchor1

Taxation problem: Scandinavian nations are characterized by high levels of taxation on income. Although I will go into the problems of Nordic model below, it must be said that these countries grow in spite of high taxes, not because of them. Indeed, several studies which examine taxation across developed countries show that when other determinants of growth are accounted for, taxation seriously diminishes growth. At the same time it must be added that while these countries have high tax on incomes, the corporate levels are low. Corporate tax average of Scandinavian nations is about 25% compared to about 40% in USA. So it is possible that the corporate sector there is balancing the economy. Hence higher tax levels are not an option in India where industry and corporate sectors constitute only a marginal share of the overall economy.

Sources: http://ideas.repec.org/p/hhs/ratioi/0130.html
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1699715

Economic history of Nordic nations: Most Scandianavian nations instituted the Nordic model in mid 1960s. Before this most of these countries reaped benefit from high growth facilitated by laissez faire policies and neutrality in the World Wars. Welfare system that you see now wouldn't have been possible had it not been for the surplus it had made during their laissez faire era. India on the other hand has no Laissez faire history. It is a country which is home to half of the world's poor. By instituting a welfare state, India would be incentivizing these poor souls to continue in their misery.

Norway : Norway is an exception among Nordic nations itself. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1960 after which the country made its switch to welfare state. When liberals in US point to the per-capita GDP of Norway, they forget to mention that much of this is a result of big oil interests. Norway is the largest oil producer and exporter in all of Western Europe. Norway produces roughly 200 barrels of oil per person per year. That puts it at number 5 in the world for per capita oil production. In other words, Norway is successful despite its government, not because of its government. India is largely import dependent when it comes to oil and has very few proven oil reserves. It cannot bank on resource wealth to fund its welfare state.

EFFICACY OF THE NORDIC MODEL

In this portion, I will discuss the problems with Nordic model itself. Given below are series of comparisons he made between Scandinavian nations and USA under various parameters. While US itself is no paragon of capitalism. Over the years it has show relatively high levels of free markets which has slightly regressed in the recent years. The main difference between the American system and the Nordic Model is that America has a medium-size welfare state and the Nordic nations have large welfare states. That explains, at least in part, why the U.S. economy generally outperforms the Nordic Model. US stats were easily available online, so I took that. Give me a beak.

As seen in Figure below US has enjoyed a faster rate of growth.According to the OECD, the U.S. grew by an average of 3 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 3.3 percent between 1992 and 2006 (meaning average growth of 3.2 percent for 1981 to 2006). The Nordic nations, by contrast, grew by an average of 2.2 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 2.7 percent from 1992 to 2006(meaning average growth of 2.5 percent over the entire period). The IMF, meanwhile, reports that U.S. growth averaged 3.1 percent from 1981–2006 compared to an average of 2.6 percent for Nordic nations in the same period.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gpTtjiA.png

Figure below, measures of per capita GDP from the World Bank, the OECD, the IMF, and the CIA all show that Americans haveabout $6,000 of additional economic output per person, significantly more than $20,000 for each family of four.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/ilG5UVr.png

Although per capita GDP is an excellent measure of overall economic output relative to population, it does not necessarily measure living standards. Comparing U.S. and Nordic living standards requires numbers for disposable income. The OECD series for disposable income in the Figure below. According to a study using 2003 data, the average person in the US had more than $27,000 of disposable income, while the average person in Nordic nations Had disposable income of barely $14,300, less than 53 percentof the U.S. level. Even Norwegians, bolstered by oil wealth, had per capita disposable income of less than $16,800, barely 62 percent of the American level. Danes and Finns are at the bottom, with less than 50 percent of the disposable income of the average American. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/anuxd8j.png

Personal consumption: In 2005, the Danish Finance Ministry produced numbers comparing per capita private consumption in OECD nations. As seen in Figure below, the average person in Nordic nations has barely 51 percent as much private consumption as an average American. The Norwegians are the most prosperous, but even their private consumption is just 56 percent of U.S. levels. Both the Swedes and the Finns have less than 50 percent of the private consumption of average Americans. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/jIIqdoc.png

As expected by the nature of free markets Nordic countries lag US when it comes to per capita GDP growth

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gjBFuGG.png

Last but not least, defenders of the Nordic Model argue that the US suffers from greater levels of income inequality. Various measures of inequality, such as Gini coefficients, confirm that “wealthy” Americans earn a bigger share of the pie than Upperincome citizens in Nordic nations. But this data is incomplete without also looking at the size of the pie. As illustrated in Figure below, the poorest 10 percent of Americans have about the same level of income as the poorest 10 percent of Finns, Swedes, and Danes. Only in oil-rich Norway is there a noticeable gap (data for Iceland not available). What differentiates America from the Nordic nations is the income of everyone else. The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts. If nations are being judged on the prosperity of their poorest citizens, then Nordic nations certainly are equal to the US. Indeed, they even have a slight advantage (though even that advantage might disappear if Nordic nations had US levels of immigration). But if nations are being judged on factors beyond just the well-being on the poorest segment of the population, then the US holds a clear edge.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/lDeXvnX.png

CONCLUSION

Excessive government diminishes growth. And although the Nordic countries’ relatively free markets mitigate the damage caused by high taxes and high spending, the burden of government is hindering economic performance. The Nordic Model is preferable to the Continental or Corporatist Model of nations such as France and Germany, which combines welfare state policies and interventionism. When I was researching this , Google news showed that Sweden plans to scale back it welfare state due to pressure. 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/swedish-elections-cracks-showing-nordic-model

These AAP Kejriwal types are constantly backing a welfare state. I am not against AP or anything, if they can just fix their economic policies, I'll be all for them. Milton Friedman famously said that you cannot have a Welfare state and open borders. Sweden seems to learning that lesson. In India's case Free markets is the best option.

[RANT] Reality v/s Perception about the state of affairs in Bengal (economically).,12,3rvcoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3rvcoi/rant_reality_vs_perception_about_the_state_of/,73,1446914505,"The trend right now is to continuously harp on certain shortcomings and create an environment of negativity about Bengal. And it's shocking how the ones who leave Bengal are busy bad-mouthing the state the most. That actually causes a very negative perception about it.

Contrary to the prevalent perception, the Bengal govt has done a significant amount of work in the last 4 years. Lets talk about them first.

->Growth:

i) Gross Value Added- India is growing at 7.5 percent while West Bengal is growing at 10.48 percent 

ii) Agriculture- India is growing at 1.1 percent, West Bengal is growing at 6.46 percent 

iii) Industries - India 5.6 percent, West Bengal 8.34 percent 

iv) Services- India 10.9 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent

v) Per Capita Income - India 6.1 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent.

These are as per statistics of the Central Statistical Organisation.

-> Investment Proposals:

i) Since TMC came to office, Rs 84,923 crore of investments are either completed or in process.

ii) In the Bengal Global Business Summit, Rs 2,43,000 crore of investment proposals are tabled and work has already started on the Rs 91000 crore within the last five months. 

iii) Changi airport has come to West Bengal creating the first ever with BAPL private sector greenfield airport in India, nobody talks about that. What is interesting is 1800 acres around the airport - 56 percent of which will have to be non-polluting industry is going to come up there, transforming that entire area as an Aerotropolis. 

iv) SAIL is already implementing on a promised Rs 16000 crore investment in the state and has now promised another Rs 40000 crore of investment. 

v) Anil Ambani's group is investing in cement. 

vi) Tata Metaliks has asked for expansion of its plant. 

vii) NTPC is coming up with two more power plants,work has already started on those. 

viii) TCS is almost ready with a new campus bringing in 20000 new jobs. Cognizant and Wipro have announced 5000 and 2400 new jobs respectively. 

ix) Wipro has started work on the construction of a new campus already. 

x) The largest Software Technology Park of India (STPI) is coming up in Kolkata for a Rs 100 crore investment. 

xi) Caparro Group has committed to investing in a small car manufacturing hub in Bengal,land has already been bought.

xii) Bengal Birbhum Coalfields, the newly formed company in which Bengal has the largest share, could well be a game changer for the industry-starved state.The company will develop Deocha Pachami, the country's largest mineable coal block, which happens to be in West Bengal's Birbhum district. 

xiii)Chinese bus manufacturing company Zhongtong has decided to set up an assembling unit at the airport city in Burdwan's Andal. The company has proposed to invest Rs 250 crore in the first phase and scale it up to Rs 1,500 crore. Zhongtong plans to manufacture buses in Andal later. 

xiv) Mahindra & Mahindra is investing 150 crores in Kharagpur.

->Finance Hub

Setting up a greenfield Finance Hub is a real tough thing. BKC took 3 decades to get built. Bangalore tried this. It failed. GIFT Tried this. In spite of ""Brand Gujarat"" and PR skills of Modi, it has failed to attract as many investors as New Town Finance Hub attracted. Getting 19 national level Financial Institutions commit investment by buying land at 13 crore / acre in a time span of 4 years is just AMAZING boss..
Is the Media ever coming up with these news? Even if they are coming up, they are portraying these things in negative light telling how many plots are yet to be sold.

->Tourism:

i) We know what traffic Darjeeling was receiving before TMC came. If you want check the pre-2011 statistics of Bagdogra Airport. Annual traffic was around 2-3 Lakhs. Last year (2015 March) it reached the mark of 1 million air passengers / year. in 2011, Bimal Gurung and his gang was creating trouble almost every other day through Bandhs and stuffs like that. Do we hear of those things now? That was MB's diplomacy and political shrewdness .

ii) Jangalmahal: It was a Naxalite den. Today we have several tourism initiatives happening there , tourists are visiting those places in good numbers. Bengalis love to roam around. They are getting new places to visit in WB itself. Tourism industry ( hotels and cottages) does not require much land and generates a lot of blue-collar employment in the form of drivers, stewards, cooks, guides,etc.

That's what a good administration was supposed to deliver.

->Financial Improvement

i) In 2010-11 (March 2011), debt-GDP ratio was 40%. In March 2015, it was 33%. 

ii) WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2011: 21,000 crore WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2015: 41,000 crore 

iii) Capital investment in state budget ( investment in creation of physical assets i.e. Roads, Bridges, irrigation canals,etc) increased by more than 500% in 4 years.

Does media ever report these incidents?

iv)Revenue Doubling happened at a time when oil prices crashed and state govt's tax collection on petrol and diesel got severely impacted.

Don't you think these show better administrative skills?

->Kanyashree Programme and Fair Price Medicine Shops

Similar models are getting implemented across many states at all-India level now. We know the good points of these schemes.This is a unique example where United Nations is now saying 53 developing countries who met in London must adopt the Kanyashree program.

->Revival of State PSUs

i)Only three states have discoms that are profitable (without subsidies) - West Bengal, Goa and Maharastra - according to the Planning Commission. 

ii) Transport PSUs were sucking up hundreds of crores of subsidy every year. Daily earnings of CSTC in 2011: 20 lakhs Daily earnings of CSTC in 2015: 30 lakhs

Now almost all the transport PSUs are profitable.

iii) Loss making Tantuja and Manjusha is profitable now. So is the newly launched Biswa Bangla Brand. It's not just about profit of these PSUs. More Profitable these companies are, more weavers, craftsmen, handloom workers can benefit from these platforms by getting more orders and earning more money. More direct as well as indirect employment is generated. Also , these profits form ""non-tax revenue"" of state budget, which helps in more capital investment.

Again, is the Media ever highlighting these things?

->FAILURES

The major failure has been in generating white collar jobs ( Both in IT and Manufacturing). And this happened because they did not market ""Brand Bengal"" well. Not giving SEZ Permission was perhaps the most stupid decision ever.

But Media is continuously highlighting these stuffs only. In 5 years, there has been only 2 Foreign Trips by MB and Media is complaining. On the Contrary, MB and her bureaucrats should have made several trips to Silicon Valley and should have tried to incentivize more Hi-Tech Companies to establish R&D Centres in Kolkata.

->BOTTOMLINE:

Every State has its own problems.

Do people in Bangalore always complain about broken roads? Do people in Gujarat always complain why GIFT could never become a success in almost 9 years or why Ahmedabad could never become a big IT Hub?

No....Boss....No

###Headline Stories

***

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

* Former RBI Governor D. Subbarao’s memoir called “Who moved my interest rate?” hit the stands last week. In the tell-all book that may cause some embarrassment to prominent leaders in the government, Subbarao [gives](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/d-subbaraos-memoirs-manmohan-singh-ignored-finance-minister-on-subbarao-term/article8850380.ece) all the dirty details of his stressful relationships with then finance ministers P. Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee. Since this book comes 3 years after his term as Governor ended, all we have to do now is wait 3 years for Raghuram Rajan (or “R3” as the social media calls him) to write a book revealing the real reason behind his resignation. Mark your calendars for 2019. 
  

* Recent research reports [indicate](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/earn/which-it-jobs-will-survive-automation-find-out/articleshow/53127553.cms) that Indian IT and Services industry is scheduled to lose about 6.4 lakh low-skilled jobs to automation over the next five years. Ugh, not another robots are taking over our jobs story. Although all the jobs at risk are at the bottom of the pyramid, this is alarming since the $160 billion IT industry is one of India’s biggest employers. We already have an R3, won’t be long before we get an R2-D2 as well. 
  

* Air India is certainly not a private sector airliner. But a lot of bureaucrats treat Air India like their own private airliner. Part of that is because they’re mandated by law to travel by Air India. That might be changing soon. In a potential policy change, bureaucrats may be [allowed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-may-lose-privilege-of-being-sole-carrier-of-government-staff-if-cabinet-note-goes-through/articleshow/53144940.cms) to choose the airline that offers the lowest fare rather than having to travel on Air India. So, Air India may lose the privilege of being sole carrier of government babus. Although, was it really a privilege before this? 
  
* You know how the bad guys in every movie always carry black suitcases full of cash to a drug deal? How much cash do you reckon is inside those suitcases? Well, if the government gets to decide, no more than ₹3 lakh. The government is considering a ban on cash [transactions](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/ban-cash-transactions-of-above-rs-3-lakh-to-curb-black-money-top-court-told-1431507) of more than ₹3 lakh. Another measure under consideration seeks to ban holding more than ₹15 lakh in cash at any time.

Detergent-maker Nirma is getting into an entirely different business altogether. It is buying the cement manufacturing assets of Swiss-group LafargeHolciem for ₹9,400 crore, [making](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/hGXG78x0Jqvbo8iS1eokPP/Nirma-to-buy-Lafarge-India-assets-from-LafargeHolcim-at-14.html) Nirma one of the top 10 cement producers of India.

Because sometimes, a regular pizza just isn’t cool enough. However, with prices starting at ₹89, early reviews have been mixed. First, terrorists attack France again, then there’s an attempted military coup in Turkey and now Domino’s launches BurgerPizza. What is even happening in the world right now.

###Headline Stories
***

**Pip Pip, Guv’nah!**

It’s here, and it’s real. The referendum to decide Britain’s fate took place last week, and a lot of things have hit the fan since then. It’s time for the Brits to wake up and smell the tea. With a 52% share of the vote, the Brexit camp won, which means the UK will now [leave](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/17/11963668/brexit-uk-eu-explained) the EU. It won’t happen next week, or next month - they now need to go through a complex procedure that can potentially take about 2 years to complete before officially becoming EU-free. They need to negotiate the terms of the exit with the EU as well as sort out some internal affairs that had been managed by the EU until now. The EU which accounts for 1/4th of global economy is also India’s single largest export market. To ELI5 the effect this will have on India - previously, Indian companies had to satisfy only one rule in order to sell products everywhere in Europe. But now, they will have to satisfy one rule in order to sell products in the UK, and another rule in order to sell products everywhere else in Europe. Nevertheless, the headline news here is that most of UK just went, “Farewell, European Union!”. Or more accurately, as the Brits would say, “Cheerio, buggers!”. 



**You Get To Exit, And You Get To Exit, Everybody Gets to Exit**

There are exits and then there are exits. But it all started with the Rexit (Rajan exiting the RBI). Now coincidentally, we’ve got an exodus of people in business and economics leaving their positions. YC Deveshwar, who’s been for 20 years the head of ITC, the billion dollar cigarettes-to-hotels firm is [leaving](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/uhmto3w6LYTfdGcXfcdjLN/Deveshwar-to-lead-ITC-as-nonexecutive-chairman-after-term-e.html) next year. SK Roy, the head of LIC, the state-run insurance company that is the single biggest domestic investor in the markets today just [tendered](http://www.firstpost.com/business/lic-chairman-s-k-roy-another-upa-appointee-resigns-before-his-5-year-term-2851360.html) his resignation as well. Roy was appointed for a 5-year term under the Manmohan Singh government. His term still has 2 years remaining but he’s calling it quits now. Can you guess the name of someone else who was also appointed under the Singh government and who also recently surprised everyone by the news of his exit? Alright, alright.. I’m sorry, I’ll move on. And now for some international resignations. Nikesh Arora, celebrity investor and ex-Google exec who was being groomed to be the next CEO of SoftBank also [resigned](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-can-t-be-ceo-in-waiting-softbank-s-nikesh-arora-explains-sudden-resignation-2226223) after they told him that founder and current CEO, Masayoshi wanted to be CEO for 5-10 more years. Kids these days, I tell you, so impatient. 48-year-old Nikesh Arora is currently busy coming to terms with the fact that he just left behind a pay package of $73 million a year.

**A ménage à trois**

A merger is when two or more companies come together to become one. Usually, mergers that are in the news refer to just two companies coming together. The *or more* part is rarely invoked. But this time, we have a rare case of merger with HDFC Life, Max Life Insurance and Max Financial Services [going](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/MJ5YsT8RS330FJhTDYJJZM/Boards-of-HDFC-Standard-Life-Max-Financial-to-meet-to-discu.html) for a threesome of mergers. Here’s how it’ll work: Max Life Insurance, the fourth-largest private insurer, will merge with parent company, Max Financial Services which will then merge with HDFC Life, the third-largest private insurer. Together, they will combine to become India’s largest private insurer. Every merger has a story behind it, albeit not always an exciting one, it’s still business and not Dan Brown. But our story begins 13.8 billion years ago with the big bang. We had some dinosaurs. Then some other stuff happened. And then in the late 1990s, India allowed private insurance companies to compete in the market which was dominated by the state-run Life Insurance Corporation. It should’ve spelled bad news for LIC but it still emerged as the winner in the competition as even today, the insurance industry is dominated by LIC. It’s no joke to compete against LIC which sells insurance policies that are basically guaranteed by the government. So you need to join forces and make allies if you want to take on the ring-leader that is LIC. And this three-way merger is only an effort to join forces and make allies.

**Funding For A Fund Of Funds That Funds Startups**

A significant part of this series always ends up being about the government even though it is supposed to be about the economy. Well, that’s because a significant part of our economy is controlled by the government through state-owned corporations and legislative policies. But the government’s influence on the economy is gradually declining because of policies like disinvestment, where the government gradually privatizes state-owned corporations. But sometimes, you just have to invest to spur growth. The government [approved](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/establishment-of-fund-of-funds-for-funding-support-to-start-ups-116062200723_1.html) a ₹10,000 crore fund that will be managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, who will use the money to invest in funds that invest in startups. With this, the government isn’t trying to encourage the creation of Indian Zuckerbergs and Gates’ - it’s trying to encourage the creation of Indian jobs (with the lowercase j). More specifically, the fund is expected to create 18 lakh jobs. 18 lakh jobs? That’s enough to feed 18 lakh poor families. Either that, or about 18 #Urbanpoors.

###Sidebar Stories

* From purchasing an eraser to issuing a press release, the government’s bureaucracy machine is known for setting up panels and committees and sub-committees and commissions to oversee everything. But not for finding a replacement for Raghuram Rajan. Jesus Christ, are we still on him? Yes, we’re still on him. The Prime and Finance Ministers are expected to [handpick](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/pm-narendra-modi-and-fm-arun-jaitley-to-select-raghuram-rajans-successor-not-a-panel/articleshow/52842311.cms) the next governor of RBI, and the news has it that they’re looking for a person with a background in economics rather than policy.

* Get ready to feel gross in your wet sandals and tip toe your way to the bathroom as soon as you get home... the monsoon is [here](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/monsoon-finally-arrives-in-drought-hit-maharashtra-90-of-state-receiving-rains-met-dept/). After being late by a week, the rains have covered more than half of the country as regions previously hit by droughts have begun getting rainfall. For farmers, this means the need to plant summer crops and for investors, this means that at least we have something to counter Brexit’s effects.

* The Food Corporation of India is the government-owned company that runs and manages the public distribution system, or what you might know as the ration shops that sell food at cheap prices. It’s the FCI that pays the extra 10 bucks while buying, so that the farmer doesn’t get exploited by having to sell for cheap. Except instead of mangoes, it’s food-grains. The government provides a lot of subsidies through the corporation - so many subsidies that the FCI now owes ₹58,650 crore to others as pending subsidy payments. Which is why it is [inviting](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/fci-to-raise-rs-20000-crore-short-term-loan/articleshow/52885209.cms) bids from banks to raise a short term loan of ₹20,000 crore. Oh yeah, because when you’re a government-owned corporation, you don’t go to the banks when you need a loan. The banks come to you.

* After a political campaign that ended with the exit of the RBI Governor, MP Subramanian Swamy is the talk of the town. And now, he has [trained](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/subramanian-swamy-now-targets-cea-arvind-subramanian-after-raghuram-rajan-exit-2868336/) his guns on Chief Economic Advisor to the government, Arvind Subramanian. In a salvo of tweets, Swamy stated that Arvind should be fired immediately. For there can only be one Subramanium.

And the award for this week’s most bizarre economic story goes to: LG Electronics India, who is [rolling](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/lg-electronics-sells-mosquito-repelling-tv-india-n594251) out TVs that come with mosquito repellent technology. The TV, which also keeps mosquitoes away when switched off, costs ₹26,500 and keeps mosquitoes that can cause diseases like malaria, zika, dengue away. Or if you think cure is better than prevention, just buy dengue insurance. Yeah, they sell those too. [Really](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/your-money/tomorrowmakersshow/48985928.cms).

US technology is no longer just about smartphones and facebook apps, it’s also about sex-sorted bovine semen. The government is in [talks](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/modi-government-looks-to-us-technology-for-increasing-domestic-cows-milk-output/articleshow/52787849.cms) with a few US-based companies that have the technology for ‘sex-sorted semen’ which ensures only female cattle are born through assisted reproduction. This comes as part of a project that aims to increase milk production and make it more profitable for the farmers of India. Feminism may not be working out for the women of India, but it’s really taking off for the cows of India.

Most, however, just stopped by the night before to bless the happy couple and skipped the actual wedding. But one prominent friend stayed through all the ceremonies over a couple of days, genial and relaxed like a favorite uncle. It was Narendra Modi, chief minister of Adani's home state of Gujarat.

In 2003,  Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, was taken to task by the Confederation of Indian Industry for the anti-Muslim riots in the state. Leading the charge were prominent industrialists like Rahul Bajaj and Jamshyd Godrej. The CII's attack on Modi provoked an angry reaction by a group of Gujarati industrialists, who organised themselves under the Resurgent Gujarat Group. Adani and Mehta were the leading lights of the RGG, which took on the CII on Modi's behalf. The CII was forced to apologise to the chief minister.

Adani, has travelled with Modi in the past year more than any other billionaire, helping him emerge as the most prominent face of India Inc. to the wider world. His wealth has more than quadrupled since Modi announced his candidacy in September 2013, the biggest gain among the country’s elite. He travelled with Modi to US, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, Japan, France and China. After most of Modi’s foreign visits, Adani bagged business agreement from these countries.

The rates at which the Adani Group bagged land from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government for its port and special economic zone (SEZ) project — between Re 1 and Rs 32 per square metre — were much lower than other companies that set up units in the state.  Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt. Among other industrial groups, K Raheja Corp was sold land at Rs 470 per sq mt, while TCS had to pay at Rs 1,100 per sq mt and Torrent Power at Rs 6,000 per sq mt.

Special Economic Zones Rules, 2016, were amended by the department of commerce, to insert a provision on claims for refund under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. The SEZ Act under which the SEZ Rules are framed did not initially provide any provision for refunds of any kind before this amendment was introduced. The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015. It appears at face value that by amending the SEZ Rules to insert a provision for companies to claim refunds on customs duty, the department of commerce is ¬allowing the Adani Power Ltd. to claim refunds on the duty that has never been paid by it in the first place [Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/149156/modi-government-adani-group/)

Ironically, the biggest black money case that has come up before the SIT so far is that of the Adani group. The Adani group allegedly took out over Rs 5,000 crore to tax havens, using inflated bills for the import of power equipment from South Korea and China, the SIT on black money was told by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Adani group vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Modi, after his rhetoric-filled ride to power, has been silent. Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S. Katoch, who was heading the directorate when the case was opened, also ended abruptly. Apart from the Adani case, the Ahmedabad ED investigators were also pursuing some of the biggest money launderers of Gujarat.[Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/58640/black-money-investigation-a-feast-of-vultures/)",6
Long post - I hate high interest rates in India.,84,35kmvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/35kmvp/long_post_i_hate_high_interest_rates_in_india/,50,1431357018,"Long time lurker. Thought I would share some of my rants about India here.
One of the problem with India is extremely high interest rates. When rates are this high (10% compared to 0-2% in many developed countries), cost of doing business is huge.


Consider the following scenarios

1) No one will invest in a business where the return is less than 10% per year. Otherwise, you will just park your money in a bank and earn interest on it. A lot of projects become unviable this way. Setting up big ticket infra projects, green field setups is virtually Impossible without government financial assistance, tax breaks.

2) Property bubble - A 20lakh loan financed at 10% rate for 20 years costs us nearly 50 lakhs including interest payments. So, even if your property prices increase by 150% in 20 years, a CAGR of 5%, you are losing money.

If you include your cost of money, You would have been better off investing those 50 lakhs in a recurring deposit instead of giving EMI. The RD will bring close to 70 lakhs. So a property price appreciation of (70-20/20) 250% or 6.8% CAGR is break even for your money. [I have oversimplified the calculation by not including rent saved, HRA etc]
Compare this to western countries, where property prices hardly rise by 0-2% y/y.

3) Polluting Truck menace - It is taking truck operators 10+ years to breakeven cost on a ageing financed truck. A truck operator will look for more than 10% annual return in order to make money on his investment. To save some more money, they cut corners and are also overloaded producing even more pollution. Read about recent NGT order banning 10+ yrs diesel vehicles.

4) Currency depreciation – Economics 101. A high interest rate depreciates your currency every year. Currency depreciation raises prices of fuels, coal, gas, important imports.

5) Trickle down effect – A lot of goods/ services which change many hands before reaching you becomes expensive, as every middle man would want to earn more than 10% on money invested. Think, cost of fruit/ vegetables you pay vs what a poor farmer receives. Think, petrol pump business, where a dealer has a commission of Rs 2+ for every litre of petrol sold.  

6) Trade deficit with China – Ever wondered why , it is so cheap to produce things in China. One of the reason is low cost of money there. We import every type of shit from China. Things we could have made right here in India.

7) Fiscal deficit from Gold – Stupid Indians keep buying gold thinking that the gold will appreciate like it did in the last  decade. We are the 2nd largest consumer of gold. In reality, the gold prices in $ are at a 5 yr low. But in India, prices have only risen. Do you know why? Hint – 40% currency depreciation..

If USD/INR was at 45 today, gold would only be worth 15k for 10gm.


I could go on and on but would now be interested in hearing your opinion.


Update1. Some of you have said that interest rates are right where they need to be. And that is 100% true. I should have been more clear while wording my rant.
It's just that - I hope for a India which has low interest rates. Obviously its not possible in near future

WTF is Demonetisation - Part II,12,5fpo2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5fpo2v/wtf_is_demonetisation_part_ii/,11,1480542366,"What is Participatory Note?
Participatory notes are not mere instruments used by Pakistan to invest in our economy. Modi says he goes to a lot of foreign countries  to bring in Foreign Investment.

Out of such Foreign Investments, the highest a country has invested is not US or the UK or France or Germany or any other major country but a tiny island called Mauritius. 

A small Island off Indian Ocean whose total population would be about 12 L! Mauritius has invested more than 40% in India. 

Many other such islands like Cayman islands etc exist. How did such islands get such huge money to invest in India and who exactly are those people? Whose money is it anyways? 

That money is none other than the illegal stash of the Indian crony capitalists! The money starts from India and goes on a sight seeing trip across many countries and finally gets to Mauritius - which then finds its way back to India as Foreign Investment!

If the illegal money that is in circulation in India is Jeevatma, the illegal money circulating around the globe is Paramatma - in the language the BJP folk can understand!

Jeevatma becomes one with the Paramatma, this indian sewer water gets mixed with International sewer waters, then when it comes back to India again via Mauritius, it is the Pure Virgin Ganges water or Foreign Investment - Modi will do snanam and worship it and welcome it with folded hands!

The very same black money that they say they are trying to eradicate, has come back as Foreign Investment, and it gets lots of subsidies when it comes back to India!

So who's taking it away to Foreign countries? How do they take it?Let's for a moment forget TATA, Birla, Ambani, Adani etc, among the fat cats there are individual fat cats like our ministers - yes Ministers! Many of these Ministers who do not even have a  standard education have property in foreign countries, coal, iron ore factories abroad and even whole islands in their names! Some of it has come out in the newspapers too!

People like Adani sell solar electricity to states and these ministers make a huge cut out of it. But do they get bribes in a sack and then carry it abroad? No, they just show a benami name and a property will be bought in that name or money transferred in his HSBC bank! So next this minister or that benami comes back as Foreign Investor!

Many of our ministers go on trips to such islands like Cayman Islands - does Modi not know of this? Will Modi ask all of his ministers to submit their travel itinerary for the period they have been in power for audit? 

Let's take an example: The Central Board of Excise and Customs, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has given a report - 'a scam involving companies inflating the value of coal imports from Indonesia for their power plants thus siphoning money abroad. Initial estimates by the agency pegged the overvaluation at Rs 29,000 crore in the period 2011-2014.'

How did this scam happen? If we had purchased directly from Indonesia, a tonne of coal cost $50. However, it was handed over to other brokers and middlemen aka crony capitalists to purchase it. Coal is still in Indonesia - but it changes hands to 7-8 different countries on paper alone! So when it comes back to India it costs $87! 

So multiply 37 * 70 for a tonne. It involves states Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Kerala! Each state has lost about 1500 Cr due to this scam.

The culprits include state parties and its minister in this along with Adani, Ambani, Ruia, Jindal, India cements etc. Adani has gained 6000 Cr illegally by supplying industrial parts for Gujarat State Electricity Ltd according to Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.

Modi travelled all over India during his election campaign using Adani's Jet. Its behind Adani's money that  Modi was able to fund his political campaign!

He travelled with same Adani to Australia to get him permission for mining rights. Just this Nov 18, Adani was given 6000 cr loan for the same Australia mining project!

Can Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ask why coal sold at $50 was sold at $87 - even if they ask they'll say it is business practice - Standard Operating Procedure! Its perfectly legal and cannot be questioned in court too!

All those companies that changed hands in the process just exist in letter pads! Benami Companies! So DRI cannot do anything about this illegal money and all these companies have understanding with the countries where they are stored - so they wont ask and even if they ask it will fizzle out!

So when the govt itself is supporting this washing of Black Money to White through such routes, where does the question of catching the Black Money arise?

Atleast here coal was bought and 29000 cr lost, but there are examples where such operations have taken place in paper alone!

There is another such Island Bahamas whose population is 3.5L only. In 2008, export from India is $ 22,00,000. In 2010 it grew to $ 280,00,000. What do you think that this 3.5 Lakh people bought from India? What was being exported from India? Two companies have done it - Reliance & Essar - petroleum has been exported. Even if the 3.5 Lakh people drive around 24*7 and eat drink and shit petrol, they can't possibly use such a huge amount of petrol as was being exported! So there you go!

This was not just carried out by Ambani's but by Reddy brothers - who swallowed the Bellari, who were powerful to move the state border of karnataka into Andhra! Such efficient people - Sushma Swaraj's disciples! They have exported very high quality iron ore - how much? From the ports the reports says 5000 shiploads have been exported. But Excise has reports only 4000 shiploads. What happened to the remaining 1000 shiploads? Where is the revenue from it? Where has it been invested?

Doesn't Modi know all this?

So Black Money is not something in a hidden box which you can go and collect it and bring it back and deposit Rs. 15,00,000 in everyone's account.  Its about handling black money practices - as we've seen above they've devised ways to make such black money laudering routes and practices as legal. This incidentally has happened more during BJP rule. No its not a biased statement.

According to World Bank report during the period 1998 - 2004, it was during the vajpayee rule that such black money practices and black money has flourished to the maximum extent in India. Now you can understand why the news came in today about BJP leading the parties in income from unknown sources. 

In 2011, after scams such as 2G etc started surfacing, Advani started a Rath Yathra against Corruption and Black Money, saying there are 70 Lakh Crores of Black Money stashed abroad, I'll bring it back"". Advani was held up as the iron Man - Lauh Purush - as if he'll act like a superman bomb all illegal stashes abroad and bring all black money back but he was bombed by Modi in 2014 who took over his role and got involved with Anna Hazare etc and personally making gullible statements to fool people about 15 L for each account.

However, during UPA rule, in a very important case for Black money, the tax evasion case by Vodafone, the SC ruled that we cannot demand such tax from them. After that, when Pranab Mukherjee brought in rules to avoid such malpractices namely, GAAR - General Anti Avoidance Rules, the person who spoke vociferously against it and did not allow it was none other than our present FM Arun Jaitlee! Not just FM but all the corporates and crony capitalists were against bringing in this rule!

During UPA rule, the BJP asked Congress to bring out names of Swiss Bank holders in Parliament. Pranab Mukherjee ridiculed them in Parliament. Swiss Banks are not giving out names, shall we send the Army? BJP kept quiet and then turned it as if Congress is not giving out names. Today, when BJP is in power, Modi is giving the same answer to SC!

Now, BJP is not keen about money stashed abroad. So they turned their attention towards internal black money (Jeevatma, remember?) So doesn't Modi know who are the kingpins involved? Ok if you don't know who can find it out - Income Tax, Enforcement directorate, Revenue Intelligence, CBI, Finance Ministry are at his disposal! So what are those departments doing?

Either they are in the payrolls of such kingpins or you all have decided not to act on them. So this whole system is nothing but a farce!

So now Modi is trying to bring Black Money out of ordinary people - who have never seen such huge amount of money as quoted in this post - let alone black money! Modi has brought in an emergency situation and panicked the people. Just before this demonetisation, Modi met and discussed with 3 chiefs of Army Navy & Airforce. Why? Because, he feared a civil unrest and wanted to avoid it. This Army has not been sent against the kingpins of black money but if the ordinary people are put to much hardships they know it will lead to outcry and want to avoid it and have taken measures for that.

After doing all this, the BJP representatives when asked if by removing 500 & 1000 notes will BM be curbed, on talk shows they are saying ""We never said anything like that. This is a step towards curbing black money.""

So why such a drastic measure has been thrust on the common man? There's a reason for their activity. Its not about Black Money or Fake Money but totally irrelevant to it!

Last Week in Parliament (July 18 to July 22),51,4uhxod,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4uhxod/last_week_in_parliament_july_18_to_july_22/,8,1469471597,"Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

___
#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

___
#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy. Raanjhaa demanded that this should be declared as a national issue as well.

___
#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways. 

___
#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

___
#A few other interesting rules (for teh lulz)
___

**Rule 349**: Whilst the House is sitting, a member-

(iii) shall bow to the Chair while entering or leaving the House, and also when taking or leaving his seat 

[We’re not worthy!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/not-worthy.gif)

(iv) shall not pass between the Chair and any member who is speaking 

[YOU SHALL NOT PASS!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shall-not-pass.gif)

(x) shall not applaud when a stranger enters any of the Galleries, or the Special Box

"SOS from mother India: Muslim But Fan Of India, Right now i don't know whom to support do anyone have solution?",0,7bkc38,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7bkc38/sos_from_mother_india_muslim_but_fan_of_india/,4,1510163182,"Hi
Am just a normal internet user from some city of India and have been touring out in many different countries from last few years.

I really love my nation and while travelling I found that we have everything what other so called developed countries have than why are we still developing?

I generally came up with few more questions while browsing through so many social networking and news channels and other print media.

I Have 1 general question from all the citizens of this country, Don't you think that the only problem is we are been fooled by few politicians?

Why I came up with this question.
I don't think all other countries with such huge population are safest for women's or they don't have any crime happening or there are no bankrupt or jobless people roaming around, every country has this and this is just a part of it.

What makes difference.
Some countries have low population and so they have managed to have better law and low rate of law breakers, some countries are so open for sex and everything that they don't have sex taboo guys roaming around to harm girls, some countries high rate of literacy and there are huge tax payers and the government is so rich that in very average amount of tax also they manage to serve the best to country and there are some countries which has huge population but they work strictly on business and make more and more vacancies to leave less unemployment in the country.

Now what this country is working on?
I found that none of the political parties are actually trying to solve the issue or jobs and tax payers and if some think of trying it out (not only now but even when congress tried few better step) the oppositions and others just try to criticize them and they try best to fool people and get rid of this solutions and try to misguide the citizens of our country.

Root cause,
No political party is trying for the best awareness and is opened up for space for public voice.

Reason:
Everyone is scared of loosing there position.

I don't say demonetization is right or wrong i am just a common man who has not studied finance or i do not know how gst is effecting people because i was not a trader or so, but i know only one thing that if stop criticizing everything and work together for benefit even for next one 3-4 years i think this country would be most powerful and most dominating in the world in ever space.

With all this criticism, blame game, dirty politics we are not heading towards any solution we are in a loop of destruction we will always be behind few other countries and we will always be developing country because the condition of been developed country keeps varying every generation with the high end techs and literacy.

We need to work together for awareness, jobs, tax payers and food quality rather then seeing who is low level scammer or who is shouting higher.

Please be aware we are not moving towards development if this situation is continued and maximum people stay against government always.

I pardon for my language if i have misspelled or there is a grammatical issues, I am not a blog writer but i am really in pain with the way things are going and if we all don't stand to support any government in position all together we will always be in the same situation forever, and i think this is the right time to open eyes and start supporting because we need a government with majority and this is that government lets support them maximum and give a try we have no other option when you have to bare it anyways why not supporting while voting again don't vote them thats all.

Government of India

Ministry of Finance

08-November-2016 09:14 IST

With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities, and for eliminating Black Money ,Government decides to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016. 




            With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities such as espionage, smuggling of arms, drugs and other contrabands into India, and for eliminating Black Money which casts a long shadow of parallel economy on our real economy, it has been decided to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations issued by RBI till now. This will take effect from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016.
 
2.         Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) in circulation in these denominations are comparatively larger as compared to those in other denominations. For a common person, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes. Use of FICN facilitates financing of terrorism and drug trafficking. Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time. High denomination notes are known to facilitate generation of black money.In this connection, it may be noted that while the total number of bank notes in circulation rose by 40% between 2011 and 2016, the increase in number of notes of Rs.500/- denomination was 76% and for Rs.1,000/- denomination was 109% during this period. New Series bank notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.2,000/- denominations will be introduced for circulation from 10th November, 2016. Infusion of Rs.2,000/- bank notes will be monitored and regulated by RBI. Introduction of new series of banknotes which will be distinctly different from the current ones in terms of look, design, size and colour has been planned.
 
3.         The World Bank in July, 2010 estimated the size of the shadow economy for India at 20.7% of the GDP in 1999 and rising to 23.2% in 2007. There are similar estimates made by other Indian and international agencies. A parallel shadow economy corrodes and eats into the vitals of the country’s economy. It generates inflation which adversely affects the poor and the middle classes more than others. It deprives Government of its legitimate revenues which could have been otherwise used for welfare and development activities.

4.         In the last two years, the Government has taken a number of steps to curb the menace of black money in the economy including setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT); enacting a law regarding undisclosed foreign income and assets; amending the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Mauritius and India and Cyprus; reaching an understanding with Switzerland for getting information on Bank accounts held by Indians with HSBC; encouraging the use of non-cash and digital payments; amending the Benami Transactions Act; and implementing the Income Declaration Scheme 2016. 

5.         In order to implement the above decisions of the Government and keeping in view the need to minimise inconvenience to the public, the following operational guidelines have been issued:-
 
(i)            Old High Denomination Bank Notes may be deposited by individuals/persons into their bank accounts and/or exchanged in bank branches or Issue Offices of RBI till the close of business hours on 30th December, 2016.

(ii)          Old High Denomination Bank Notes of aggregate value of Rs.4,000/- only or below held by a person can be exchanged by him/her at any bank branch or Issue Office of Reserve Bank of India for any denomination of bank notes having legal tender character, provided a Requisition Slip as per format to be specified by RBI is presented with proof of identity and along with the Old High Denomination Bank Notes. Similar facilities will also be made available in Post Offices.

(iii)        The limit of Rs.4,000/- for exchanging Old High Denomination Bank Notes at bank branches or at issue offices of Reserve Bank of India will be reviewed after 15 days and appropriate notification issued, as may be necessary.

(iv)        There will not be any limit on the quantity or value of Old High Denomination Bank Notes to be credited to the account of the tenderer maintained with the bank, where the Old High Denomination Bank Notes are tendered. However, in accounts where compliance with extant Know Your Customer (KYC) norms is not complete, a maximum value of Rs.50,000/- of Old High Denomination Bank Notes can be deposited.

(v)          The equivalent value of the Old High Denomination Bank Notes tendered can be credited to an account maintained by the tenderer at any bank in accordance with standard banking procedure and on production of valid proof of Identity.

(vi)        The equivalent value of the Old High Denomination Bank Notes tendered can be credited to a third party account, provided specific authorisation therefor accorded by the said account holder is presented to the bank, following standard banking procedure and on production of valid proof of Identity of the person actually tendering.

(vii)      Cash withdrawal from a bank account, over the counter will be restricted to Rs.10,000/- subject to an overall limit of Rs. 20,000/- in a week for the first fortnight, i.e., until the end of business hours on November 24, 2016.

(x)          For those who are unable to exchange their Old High Denomination Bank Notes or deposit the same in their bank accounts on or before December 30, 2016, an opportunity will be given to them to do so at specified offices of the RBI on later dates along with necessary documentation as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India.

I could not focus properly and I honestly don't have interest in finance field(first two levels of CA were easy for me and this final is like torture to me). I completed IGNOU BCOM(As regular BCOM is not allowed while pursuing CA). I will complete CMA(course like CA but relatively easy) this February. I am interested in technology. I self-learned various things like web development and IOT stuff. I would not get bored doing or experimenting these stuff. 

Are there any good short term courses either related to this stream like CISA (which includes IT+ Audit) or any other different stream altogether. how is business analytics course by [IIDT](http://www.iidt.edu.in/courses.php). I am depressed right now. 

I am worried about switching streams. Here in India people mostly give jobs based on your degree (at least eligibility is considered based on having certain degrees).

It's time for Indians to invest in Canada,0,7oony4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7oony4/its_time_for_indians_to_invest_in_canada/,3,1515329817,"It's time for Indians to invest in Canada

Jagdish Pathak

There are more than one million Indian-origin immigrants in Canada. But compared to rising number of Indian-origin immigrants, Indian investment has not kept pace in Canada. However, slowly but steadily, Indian investments are trickling into the Canadian economy. Economic stability has become key to Canada's success and is decisive in attracting investors from all over the world to its shores. Investment in Canada is considered a safe haven for investors' hard-earned money and continues to represent a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. 

Canada is the No. 1 investment destination in the G7 and was ranked 4th in the world as the best country to conduct business over the period 2010-14, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report. 

Indian investors have still been shy about investing in Canada. Most investors from India prefer the UK and Europe as well as the countries of the Middle East, historically. Outside this region, Indian investments are scattered and limited. Canada is a stable, secure nation, and endowed with abundant natural resources. Its currency has always been very stable and its safest borders are with the largest economy of the world. Canada/US relations can be described as the best that any two nations can have. 

Canada ranks 27th in terms of FDI investment in India and its investments are mostly in the development sector. Whereas Indian FDI approved until 2009 in Canada is restricted to $570 million and ranks as the 20th destination of Indian investments. 

Recently, in Windsor, I saw a big hoarding on the road showing the name ""Aditya Birla"" on it. I stopped and looked at it with admiration, thinking, at last, Indian investors have made up their mind to make Canada their destination for good. 

Indian investors should consider Canada and especially the province of Ontario to be the hub of their North American business activities. Ontario has liberal laws, a huge existing infrastructure, and various tax benefits to investors, relatively milder climate, fertile farmlands and, without doubt, some of the best golf courses in the world in your neighborhood. 

People here are well aware of Indian investments in the automotive sector of the UK. During the purchasing phase of the Jaguar and Land Rover deal by Tata, India and its investors were commonly discussed in Ontario bars and restaurants. Ontario is the hub of automotive industries and support services for manufacturing automobiles of big-3: US and Japanese car manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. Southwestern Ontario is a key entry point for US and South American markets. 

Canadians are very knowledgeable about India and its information technology-related successes. India is no longer a nation of beggars and snake- charmers in the minds of a younger generation of Canadian citizens. Growth of the Indian software industry has made a big mark on the Canadian psyche. 

Any investment in Canada will have to be planned over the long term similar to US investors in the past. Canadian oil and energy, forestry, mines and minerals, and gold and diamond resources are some of the best resources for investors to look at. The Canadian higher education system is one of the best in the world and at par with the US, resulting in students from across the globe studying and performing high quality research. 

Investors from India are relatively conservative by nature and prefer to satisfy some critical marks before deciding to invest. Canada is one such country which should be the destination of long-term investors from India. One might look at some of the investments made by Indian investors in the Ontario province and think how much is there on offer in this well-endowed province alone. Investments by Essar group in energy and steel, by Mahindra Satyam and Wipro in the IT sector are a good beginning. However, the quantity of investment is negligible, compared to China, which is making substantial investment in the core sectors of oil and energy, solar and wind power generation and forestry. 

A strategic investment in developed nations like Canada goes with the Indian aspiration of becoming a global power. Indian investors can fulfill such desires in conjunction with the geo-political leadership potential of India.

I got inclined towards finance in my first sem itself (have done coursera courses and regularly read) and have been trying to accentuate it since then. I have had some experience since my first year which is as follows,

- Have had experience as a business development intern in my first sem and also as a summer equity research analyst at a startup.
- Devised and organized an event related to securities and trading during the techno-management fest of my college.
- I'm the vice-president of business at the Google Students Club 
- I handle the finances and the sponsorships at a solar race car team. Have been responsible for major sponsorships that the team has had.
- I'm a campus ambassador for Uber as well.

The interview is at a VC firm which also focuses on renewable energy. So what are some questions I should be prepared for?

Why Modi supporters just don't get it the problem of corporate debt. NPA's. And the recent bailout of PSU banks.,26,3k2pic,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3k2pic/why_modi_supporters_just_dont_get_it_the_problem/,24,1441733739,"I write this knowing that Modi supporters seriously lack understanding of the lending business,economics and business in general  and will probably make some half-assed excuse for the 75000 crore bailout but lets look at some figures.  But this needs to be said in light of todays FM meeting which will used to further bailout these idiots in corporate India who have used public money and in return just done what they have always done - misuse the capital. Not to mention are trying to force Rajan to cut interest rates to save their own ass despite savers siginficantly suffering in the last 3-4 years due to negative real interest reducing India's savings signifcantly and forcing people into risk assets like equities, (which are incidentally now down 13% from the top).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS - Savings % gdp.

China's corporate debt to GDP is around 160% of GDP. 

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/chinas-corporate-debt-at-160-of-gdp-twice-us-level/articleshow/48141056.cms

India's corporate debt - taking into account private sector lending growth is around 53.8% . (Based on 2014 figures and credit growth).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FS.AST.PRVT.GD.ZS

China has 3x the loan as a % of gdp. Yet has 4x lower NPA on its banks balance sheets. And despite that its banks are facing a debt crisis.  It too has implemented a lot of basel 3 norms which started around 2013 (an excuse used by Modi supporters to justify restructuring when in reality India already employs capital adequacy rations which basel 3 is has asked to be implemented by 2018 making the implementation irrelevant). Even if you take into account China's shadow banking industry its still much lower. 

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FB.AST.NPER.ZS/countries?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=asc

The reason I mentioned China is because China's growth most of which has come in the last 15 years going from a 1.7 trillion economy in the year 2000, to a 10 trillion economy was not driven by FDI as most pundits in India would have believe. But by a massive expansion in credit and therefore investment . Something to the tune $40 trillion dollars. This has led to what many believe its a massive credit crisis resulting for mal-investment, and the root cause of the asset bubbles around China. Not to mention the slowdown of economy.

Latest figures show India's NPA's stood at 5.3 percent. 

http://www.livemint.com/Industry/PSkRuIxPOtkZBDECcgTHIK/Allout-efforts-on-to-bring-down-PSU-banks-NPA-Jaitley.html

So what does this tell us? 

1. Massive amount of corruption in lending especially by PSU's.
2. A small percentage of Indians mostly a few big wigs and politically connected people continue to avail loans without any significant collateral, and when they can't pay back these loans the politicians just help the restructure loans.

How times will the tax payers have to bailout these banks? Even if we do bail them out this time which we have. How long before we are at the same place again. People say oh we will implement basel 3.  But let me ask you this, India already implements most of the capital adequacy standards asked for in Basel 3 so what will basel 3 do?

All this is crony capitalism of the highest standard. 

And now with the latest meeting happening today in the finance. The corporate sleazeballs have asked for their NPA's to be restructured under a separate vehicle known as the restructure bank so 'lending can start again'. 

What really needs to be done and will never be done because the corporate 'honchos' which the fiscal hawks that Modi supporters are in awe of, continue to use PSU banks as their own piggy bank. Of course a lack of backlash because of blind supporters means nothing going to change.

In reality whats needs to be done is no restructuring and bailouts but real changes.

1.Privatise all PSU banks.

2. Create a watchdog which is independent like the RBI to oversee lending standards. 

3.Implement stronger lending standard with internetional standards to account for fraud, and international models which banks like JP morgan etc use when they lend.

Again I don't see this happening. Caravan just published an article (on Ruai's but its all the same anyway) which shows how audacious the Adanis' and Ambanis are. And how they constantly just get more and more money every year.  Meanwhile I don't expect Modi supporters to ever go against their dear leader .

So enjoy paying taxes and saving with PSU's only for your money to directed towards crony capitalism.

Demonetisation and Bike Service,16,5ipl9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ipl9r/demonetisation_and_bike_service/,5,1481939163,"WARNING! THIS IS DRUNK RANTING. READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

It was a cold fucking day. I had to do something I had been putting off for quite some time -- get my bike serviced. I called up the closest service centers to ask if they accept payment by card and I learnt that the nearest service centre that accepts cards was 18 kilometres away. I had to do this nevertheless. As I had said, I had been putting this off forever and I cannot ride her without the service she needs.

So, rode her to that far off service centre and I reached by 13:00. The dude outside noted her number, made a job sheet, and handed out the customer copy to me. He told me that there's a mall nearbly in case I wanted to watch a movie, or I could just wait in the customer lounge. I decided to wait. There was a stupid Govinda movie on the TV -- he was double acting as a cop and his goofy twin. I sat through it. Boredom makes you appreciate the stupidest things. By the time the movie got over, I had checked to see if they had taken my bike in. They hadn't. I was getting impatient. I was getting hungry. I decided to look around for food. I found a place that sold Punjabi sandwiches, whatever the hell those were. I thought I'd pass. I walked further and I found a place cheap and crowded. It was *parathe zabardast parathe*. Crowded is nice. Crowded means you won't have diarrhoea the next morning. So, I walked in and I had a double egg paratha. I was filling as fuck and I paid him with the last 20 rupee note that I had on me.

I walked back to the service centre. They hadn't taken my bike in. That was disheartening. I decided to go and sit in the customer lounge. The aroma of the paratha that my nose had gotten used to made me realise how stinky this ""lounge"" was. It smelt of old unwashed clothes, dandruff, and grease. Anyway, I was sleepy and I dozed off.
I woke up an hour later. My bike hadn't been taken in. I talked to the manager. He said something about a queue. I grumbled and I went back to the customer lounge. I listened to music on my phone for an hour and it was 17:00. Two hours to close shop. A skinny dude finally takes my bike in. I was relieved.

The mechanic asked me if there are any problems. I told him what I had to say. He asked me where I was coming from. I told him.

""Bro, that's far away. Don't you know we have a service centre there?"" he asked.

""Yeah, but they don't accept payment by cards,"" I said.

""Oh, right.""

One of his colleagues walked by.

""Dude, the finance guy called,"" the colleague said. ""We have to wait for November's salary until January, or we have to accept in old notes.""

""I'm not taking old notes *bhencod*,"" he said. ""What if I fail to deposit into my bank account?""

""You've got a point. Yeah,"" said the colleague and he walked away.

""Your bike's sorted,"" the mechanic said. ""They'll clean it. You can make your payment by then.""

I proceeded towards the floor manager and I got my job card. I walked towards the billing counter.

That's when I saw it --  a helpdesk, a distraught girl behind it, and two cops in front of it.

""We hear that this place is accepting and transacting in old notes,"" the fat cop said.

""No, sir. The only old notes we have are from before 9 November 2016,"" the girl said.

""But, we got a call from here saying that your salaries are being disbursed in old notes. DON'T YOU DARE BULLSHIT ME!"" the fat cop bellowed.

The girl, evidently nervous, said, ""Sir, I don't know what you're talking about. We don't accept old notes anymore.""

""Who's phone number is this? We got the call from this number,"" he asked her showing an incoming call on his phone.

""Sir, this number is a common office contact,"" she said, ""Everybody uses it.""

""Okay, so that's how you're gonna play it. I want to see your cashier in two minutes,"" he said.

The cashier was behind his counter and I was having my billing done. I told him that I wanted to pay using my card.

""We're not accepting cards,"" the cashier said.

""Well, I don't have any cash. All I have is my cards,"" I told him.

""Give me five minutes,"" he told me. It looked like he was shitting his pants after the cop asked for the cashier. The cop was then standing beside me and staring intently into the cashier's face.

""Go on. Swipe his card,"" the cop said, ""I can wait for a couple of  minutes.""
 
The swiping machine was in the floor manager's room and the cashier took me along. After the swiping business was done, he said, ""Bro, I can't go back to my cabin and get your invoice. The cops are right there. I'll tell the floor manager to release your bike.""

""Cool, whatever,"" I said.

He talked to the floor manager about my bike. ""The cleaning isn't done yet,"" the floor manager said,""It's gonna take some time.""

I loitered around the shop floor and the customer lounge for some more time and my bike was finally clean. The cashier walked in and handed me my invoice.

""I had to get in there for other customers anyway. Thought I'd give you your invoice,"" he said.

""What happens now?"" I asked him out of curiosity.

""I don't know, bro. *Bhenchod*, these cops probably didn't even get a call from here. Maybe they just want a bribe. One shop a day for them I guess. That girl in reception in new. It's sad that she has to go through this,"" he said. ""Gotta go, man. They are quizzing our GM now, but I have to be there in case they need paperwork.""

""Thank you. Goodbye,"" I said.

""Goodbye,"" I said to the floor manager.

""We're used to shit like this,"" the floor manager said,"" Running a business isn't exactly easy in this shitty city. Goodbye and good night.""

And I came home on my serviced bike, under-dressed for the winter night, shivering in the cold, my hands cold as fuck, thinking of that poor receptionist and the cashier.

tl;dr Went to a service centre to get my bike serviced. Cops hassle them saying that they're transacting in old notes. They say that they're used to this kind of hassling by the cops.

p.s. I'm down quite a bit of Old Monk as I type this.

p.p.s. This shit ain't political. I just wanted to share something I've seen. I just wanted to share how big changes are a pain in the ass for businesses as well.

Starting salary?,2,5ohznb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5ohznb/starting_salary/,8,1484687703,"I am a 22 years old NRI living in Thailand. Had my education from Thailand. Graduated with BBA in Finance (GPA 3.57/4.00) a year ago. Worked in sales in the diamond industry in Mumbai and with my dad in Thailand (we have a family business of loose diamonds). I am not enjoying working in my family business as much and I would love to shift back to Mumbai (love that city!). I was wondering what starting salary (and in which industry) can I expect with a college degree, MS Office, Thai language, and sales experience as my skills?

I was looking for some website that shared good statistical data, like sales numbers of phones (by brand/model), revenue of different businesses etc. All I get on googling is news figures on papers with often very poorly presented data (wall of paragraphs where a graphic would have been so much better), and only data limited to a particular event, not organized searchable stuff.

I saw this awesome site called Statista, but it's behind a huge paywall.

I have some examples that I found good below:

Bloodbath Continues On Stock Market; Sensex Falls 1200 Points - 11 Points You Need To Know,3,7vlecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7vlecu/bloodbath_continues_on_stock_market_sensex_falls/,0,1517926185,"> ""The Sensex and Nifty suffered a bloodbath today, tracking a selloff in global equity markets. Overnight, the Wall Street suffered its biggest intraday decline in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a loss of about 1,200 points - nearly 4.6 percent.

* The trigger for the latest global selloff is Friday's job data in US, which showed American wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009. This has raised alarm about higher inflation and with it potentially higher interest rates.

* In anticipation of the faster-than-expected rate hike from the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, bond yields have spiked in the US, undermining the attraction of equities. Higher bond yields are also seen as negative for emerging markets and commodity prices.

*  Though Finance minister Mr. Arun Jaitley Killed Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency but showed their interest in Blockchain technology, people still likely to [understand all in & Out of Cryptocurrency](https://www.eduonix.com/complete-steemit-course-earn-cryptocurrency-for-free?coupon_code=edu15) as well as interested to purchase it

A fall in global oil prices is seen as positive for India as the country imports bulk of its requirement.

* Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday attributed the downslide in the local bourses to selloff in global markets. ""It is not due to the Budget or the LTCG (long-term capital gains tax),"" he said.

* Apart from the global selloff, the domestic sentiment has been hit by the Budget announcement of 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains accrued from equity investments, say, analysts. The Sensex fell over 800 points on Friday and over 300 points on Monday.

* The Street would also be closely watching [Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy stance](https://www.ndtv.com/business/rbi-seen-taking-tough-stance-on-inflation-in-monetary-policy-review-1808713) tomorrow.

I thought it would be an interesting exercise to seek your views about the Demands for Grants for ministries this year. These documents show how much money is being proposed to be allotted for every ministry. *The increase/decrease in the grants indicates the focus areas of this Government.*

[Here is a summary of all demands](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dgsum.pdf). It will help you quickly glance through the major figures.

[Another detailed summary which will help you see each demand for departments under the ministries](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/alldg.pdf)

[Ministry-wise detailed demands can be found here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/dg.asp?pageid=1)

Example of how we can go about discussing this: I found something interesting [here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dg30.pdf) with regards to Drinking water and sanitation. The budget for the previous year Rs 12,217 cr, it has been slashed to Rs 6,243 cr.  That's a 48% reduction. I am trying to figure out why is there such a big drop and how it will affect the overall scene of national water resources. 

I must tell you that I am no expert in finance. So perhaps some of you who do work in the area can help me waddle through this massive budget? And in the process, find out what is happening to the ministries that interest you.

If you put up some interesting suggestions, I will include your inputs in the brief I am preparing for MP /u/tathagatasatpathy. 

Session resumes tomorrow and you can follow the budget discussion as it happens. I will alert /r/india regarding that everyday by putting up the [List of Business](http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Business/listOfBusinessCurrent.aspx) for the next day, so that this can become a daily input seeking session.

"Budget 2018: Cryptocurrency is not a legal tender, but government will keep exploring blockchain technology",2,7uije8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7uije8/budget_2018_cryptocurrency_is_not_a_legal_tender/,0,1517518480,"The Narendra Modi government is looking to oust cryptocurrencies from India but has a lot of affection for blockchain. Keeping that in mind no wonder in future Blockchain technology will replace all mediatory authorities from financial transaction & Indians will start to [learn fundamental knowledge of Blockchain technology](https://www.eduonix.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-essentials)

The distributed ledger technology is becoming a hot favorite in Asia’s third-largest economy for solidifying information, alerting all stakeholders, and preventing tampering. So much so that, in his budget speech on Feb. 01, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced plans to adopt blockchain technology.

> “The government will explore the use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy,” 

Jaitley said.

Most commonly known as the technology underpinning the likes of bitcoin and Ether (of Ethereum-fame), blockchain is a digitized and decentralized public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Stripping away the financial application, blockchain is essentially a bookkeeping platform that can be accessed by anybody on the internet but is owned by nobody.

> “Once you have a blockchain, the big spreadsheet in the cloud serves as a record-keeping system that can’t be forged and can’t be reversed,” 

said Nicolas Cary, the co-founder, and president of [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) (the company, not the technology).

**Eager governments**

Blockchain technology is already making waves in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The government there is working with Swedish startup ChromaWay to set up a blockchain-based land registry system that allows people to collateralize property, get loans, and invest against that asset. Tracking property ownership using blockchain allows people to circumvent disputes, frauds, and errors, while also lessening the administrative hassle of registrations and title transfers.

Beyond land registries, blockchain can also put an end to other fraud like identity theft. To reduce the chances of getting hacked, a growing concern in India, the web-based platform can manage digital IDs. 

>“Currently, if you sign up or pay for something on the internet, you turn over unencrypted personal info that gets stored all over internet…creating a honeypot that attracts attackers to breach that service,” 

Cary said. 

With blockchain, only encrypted, relevant information will be released whenever necessary.

Recently, the Maharashtra government called upon industry leaders, researchers, and others to devise ways of incorporating blockchain in e-governance operations. 

> “The government is one of the biggest data creators and data consumers. Blockchain will bring in more efficiency, transparency, accountability, and accessibility in data flows,” 

the state’s chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, said at the Maharashtra Technology Summit (MTech) on Jan. 17.

Amid all the talks of curbing cryptocurrencies, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, still believes that blockchain technology is ripe for adoption. Banks in India are already relying on blockchain to enable overseas transactions, international remittances, and other processes.

The spread of blockchain use in the private sector use of in industries like insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, among others, could also lessen significant burdens that befall the government.

> “Capitalising on the blockchain technology could open new ways of securing peer-to-peer lending transactions, boosting trade finance, fintech and information repository sectors,”

aid Sapan Gupta, the national practice head of banking and finance at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.

> “By segregating the use of blockchain from crypto-currencies reflects the government’s intention to use the technology in a gradual and safer manner before it gets into concepts like replacing currencies.”

**Positive side-effects**

Using blockchain to monitor supply chains means the journey of a good can be tracked from sourcing to their sale by collecting information in the secured cloud-based ledger.

For instance, in the food and retail industry, shipments can be tracked and digitally recorded via a blockchain in real time.

> “This can save lives in the event of an outbreak of food-borne illness,” 

Daniele Bianchi, an assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, said. 

> “This is obviously helpful both for consumers and the government. Especially in emerging economies whereby the supply chain is typically not easy to track.”

Just like identity theft becomes harder, meddling with critical digital assets—like patient consent records in the healthcare sector or insurance payouts—also becomes less of a concern since no single authority can modify the records. At Bajaj Finserv, the holding company of Bajaj Group’s non-banking financial company (NBFC) and insurance firms, blockchain technology is being used to simplify travel insurance claims. If a flight is delayed, that information comes to the system and the claim amount is automatically generated and paid without the customer having to even file a claim.

There are currently over 40 Indian startups working on blockchain technologies in various industries like finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and logistics, according to Sangeeta Devni, a programme manager at the IT industry trade body NASSCOM’s 10,000 startups initiative. But real-world applications are still few.

**Still learning**

After interviewing early adopters, both on the customer side and vendor side, consultancy firm Deloitte recognised a slew of deterrents to using blockchain technology (pdf) that exist in the Indian market. From a lack of awareness to a dearth of trustworthy vendor partners to cybersecurity concerns, various challenges persist.

> “The main danger comes from hacking, that is, the innovation of the blockchain brings new type of attacks which are far less understood and much less mitigated as those occurring in conventional database management architectures,” 

Bianchi warned.

Is everything all right with Indian Railways? No.,5,40wqci,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/40wqci/is_everything_all_right_with_indian_railways_no/,18,1452788246,"There is this perception that is being created that Indian railways is performing very well under Suresh Prabhu. Some announcements, anecdotes and his own prompt response on twitter are often given as an evidence. But the reality as often is the case is more nuanced than that. Let's see some news from other side of the aisle: 

> [Rail freight volume tumbles in November
](http://www.livemint.com/Money/vWAdyKIjZiZ0ZwJH9FzPzJ/Rail-freight-volume-tumbles-in-November.html)

> Deceleration in freight volume growth is a continuing saga at the Indian Railways. **Compared with 8.5% growth a year ago, freight volumes fell 4.2% in November this year**. In November 2013, volume grew 3%

> Even passenger volumes have dropped 2.6% 

> Thanks to rate hikes, gross earnings of the Indian Railways till October are 8% higher than the previous year. But they are almost 9% lower than the budget estimates

[Slowing rail freight volume growth points to poor state of economy](http://www.livemint.com/Money/dtcu77hT9hX5n7TgsgUMGL/Slowing-rail-freight-volume-growth-points-to-poor-state-of-e.html)
>
Freight volume growth slows to 2% in June quarter compared with 4% a year ago; In absolute terms, the incremental freight volumes have almost halved

> More than three-fifths of the Railways’ revenues come from freight services. The slowdown is not seen in revenue, thanks to the freight hikes. Goods revenues increased 6.5% in July. In the four months to July, they are up 13.5%. Though revenue growth is encouraging, it is way below the budget estimates. Thankfully, expenses are also rising at a slower-than-estimated pace. But the gap between the budget estimate and the actual amount is not as large as it is in the goods revenues.

> Compared with a year ago, expenditure on construction of new lines and doubling of tracks increased by more than one-third in the first four months of the current fiscal year

[Railway passenger fares may go up
](http://www.thehindu.com/business/railway-passenger-fares-may-go-up/article8082709.ece)

> Passengers may have to pay higher fares following the finance ministry’s recent decision to cut gross budgetary support to railways ministry by Rs.12,000 crore

> For freight, barring coal, the core sector is not so robust with cement, steel and construction sectors performing poorly. We may have to look at the bitter pills of increasing the passenger fares apart from cutting costs.

> Recently, the government had increased Tatkal booking charges by up to 33 per cent for travel in sleeper class, AC-III tier, AC-II tier and executive class.

[Reading between the railway tracks: Turnaround plan and the numbers
](http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/reading-between-the-rly-tracks-turnaround-plan-and-the-numbers/)

> **Most vital signs of a commercial organisation are flashing red.**

> By December-end, the Railways had carried just 8 million tonnes more freight than last year. The Budget idea of carrying 85 million tonnes more by March 31, 2016, again looks difficult to achieve 

>By November, the Railways had spent only 44% of its capital expenditure budget. It has spent only 41% of funds allocated for doubling.

>**Only 28% of the Rs 1,748 crore allocated for works under passenger amenities has been spent so far.**


So we see a picture of Indian railway where it's financial health is in poor state. It is not able to meet the projected revenue and it is not able to get work done as fast as it needs to even when the funds are assured.

Example of Unintended Consequences - IIM Selections [NP],19,376j2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/376j2w/example_of_unintended_consequences_iim_selections/,17,1432569255,"I have been planning to write about this for some time now. I was associated with MBA preparation industry for a long time and wanted to write about how something good like RTI ended up spoiling the selection process at IIMs.

Background - Till few years ago, anyone could dream to be in IIMs, even if you have bad marks in school and college. Get a good percentile and if you show great acumen in the interviews, there is a good chance you will get selected. I know of people who scored ~50% in graduation and could get through top IIMs. 

Was the selection process subjective - Yes

Then RTIs came into picture and people started asking for details on selection and objectifying the criteria. I have to mention it here that that the authorities at IIMs have the pleasure of plenty. It is a rejection process than a selection process. So, rather than instituting a better process they added qualification criterion (e.g. Marks in Xth, XIIth, Grad etc) and only if you clear that, you get shortlisted for an interview. So now, in the past few years, students who have performed exceptionally well in academics throughout their life can only dare to apply to IIMs (no pun intended :p).

It is my personal view that when you are creating Business managers, curriculum marks are hardly an indicator. Skills like Relationships, People Management, Creativity, Street smartness are missing in the people who have been academic all their lives. They can be really great as number crunchers and a domain like Finance suits them well. 
Hence in the past few years, b-schools have been creating degree holders, not business managers.

So, I think there are 2 unintended consequences of this - 

1) RTI in spite of being a good tool, ended up making lot of deserving people miss the bus, of course helped by the laziness of the selection authorities.

2) The folks who are smart, are starting up.

"[R] Conflicts with mom about caste, being women and much more..",10,4j6kni,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4j6kni/r_conflicts_with_mom_about_caste_being_women_and/,8,1463178616,"I wanted to post this to r/relationships, but would have taken time explaining all the caste shit, so here I am.

So, I am not a bramhim. I am from OBC who doesn't have any official paper saying that I am OBC because it won't mean much (=no monetary benefits). I am from a well-off family and I won't even need any monetary help/ reservation either. My native place is pretty small.. barely a population of 500-600 peeps. All members of my family are in the upper middle class bracket (how do I know? Well, we went from shopping for groceries for 100-500 rs, to shop for ""aesthetic"" art stuff at Jahangir Art Gallery). 

Shit is about to hit the fan so buckle up!

A month ago, my relative from native place married the woman of his dreams who doesn't belong to our caste. We are all cool with it because he did really love her and so did she and she was almost like my elder sister (I don't have one). Everyone in my family is okay, however, whenever there's talk about their marriage, my mom will always quote ""see? both his (relative's father) kids married to persons from different caste"". And this tone is always so fucking terrible, and what worst that my entire clan only SHOWS to be okay with it which I found out like yesterday.

She(bride) mingles very well with the 14-21 age group in the family. She is 25 I think and my relative is 28, it doesn't matter cause they do seem great and while he has to a stable job, she works at home and runs a beauty salon in nearby city and it's going well. The relative's elder sister (40+) also married a guy outside the caste and she was completely abandoned by her parents, till they realized that she was basically handing all finances. They ""forgave"" her, yet treat as if she no longer has any business in ""her"" family.

WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. THIS.

Now, what's worst that all the people mentioned above at at least metric (matrix pass? 12th? Idk.) rest are graduated in professional field - medicine, accounting, engineering and everyone lives in a respected society and yet this bag of deepshit!!!

Now, now, as I said I don't have a caste certificate, because my grandpa (dada) was too lazy to care about it. However, my nani got my 2 cousins registered and this blew up the family like fucking Tsar Bomba. My cousins didn't want any affiliation because we all are good in academics and we can pretty much afford the fees for general category. We (as in my cousins and I) think that it's just a disability certificate and that an entire generation hasn't used it (my mom and mamas didn't have it) so we won't use it either. Now, You would say that's good because, well we aren't being asshole, but my family literally wants us (the future gen.) to be one. Yet, these guys will criticize the ""free-loaders"" and your daily WhatsApp shitposting. If irony were indeed a person, it would have like shot itself fucking a billion times. Y U SO STUPID?

Now, as we (the new gen.) are hitting 20s, our parents are like do you like any guy/grill? Hope he/she isn't a bramhin. Don't bring us shame. While, the irony is that we all have family friends who are bramhin - that too Punekars (esp in VilleParle)!! My best friends right from school to college are bramhins. I didn't gave a fuck about it, but have to admit that bramhin make the best fucking amti in the whole universe. Take that mom!! We literraly grew up in a bramhin environment and never have I ever seen this kind of fucked up shit in ANY of my or my cousins' friends family. Like, seriously, bramhins - the ones I have met and grew up with - are the most liberal folks. YOu call them all the names, but they would alwyas stick by you and drown you in their best fucking amti with ghee. Very close knitted and very very open minded. 

Now, the guy I have been with is a bramhin and my mom knows this. She is too prude to ask me about him so she just checks my phone bill to see whom I call the most. 

OTOH, my man's mom has called me many times and we talk like 2-3 times a week, and damn she is a fucking marshmallow. I am gonna steal her if I don;t get to marry my man. She is like the most humble, yet funny mom anyone could ever have. She doesn't know shit about FB and as my man works and I am still pursuing masters, I help her with it and god, she is amazing! All his cousins and elder than us and some even have kids. I haven;t met all of them, but they too, do know about us and tease my man. Lol, he blushes more than I do :p Many of his cousins have married out of caste (I asked him out of curiosity once), but no one is really interested in gossips as long as they are happy. Only this one guy had 498A misused against him, so his clan has been a little susceptible since, but that's about it. Every lady cousin of his went to a even warm home and all his ""vahinis"" are super close and cool. Yes, they still live in a Wada. 20+ folks under one roof!! 

My parents have been separated since my birth. Later, she had a fling with this guy who abused me, but she didn;t care. I grew out of it thanks to my hostel counselor and later, this guy I met - fucking love him he is my best friend!

I am almost like a family member to his little family of three. But, my mom won;t say anything about it at all. It's like, she doesn;t care or it's breaking her heart to see me go away, whatever. his mom always ask me how was my days and we regularly chat (I am in mumbai and he and his family is in Pune). I even taught her Skype. This is like, the sunshine I want and on the other hand, my own folks are deep in the darkness like caste, shaming and shit.

Holy shit. It's 2016. Why do I even have to care about it? Aren;t we (my clan) educated? These folks will go on and on with their ultra right wing shit and India needs discipline (like dictator ship) and reservations should be abolished and shit and yet behave like living in 1600s mindset (whatever that means!).

Now, recently, my mom has got really passive aggressive about how being a women is about having family, children and stuff. 

To top it off, this is what she said when we had a talk about children.

I was telling how a painful past of a child fucks up the puberty ago/ teenage hood, to which she just said, it's the choice of parents to bring a child in this world. God has given me you so I get to choose what to do with you. To which I said, but a child is a human too, he has rights as well. To which she said, no. All children are gift of god and only parents will decide for them.  

NO. YOU HAVE SEX TO HAVE BABIES. HOLY SHIT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING THIS TALK????? 

Where do I go from here? I can't move out and she is like turning into some batshit fucking crazy person. She did everything on her own, bought a home, a car, raised me (in hostels though), manages all finances of her own and mine and now, she is hitting 50s and this shit has started. She goes like, now you'll be gone (married) and then who will look after her as she doens;t even have a son and shit like that.

How BJP is ensuring their monotony in Indian politics and stay in power,0,61l7in,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/61l7in/how_bjp_is_ensuring_their_monotony_in_indian/,7,1490557961,"There are many polices initiated by NDA after they came to power. 
For example,
* Financial inclusion
* The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015
* Direct subsidies
* Aadhaar
* Demonetization
* Recent financial bill etc

When we take a closer look at these policies, we can see a certain pattern of corruption and dirty politics in them.

For example, **the electoral Bonds** ( http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/explaining-electoral-bonds-in-india/article9524904.ece) . This is a policy to increase the fund of the BJP and its allies. Now, people can buy this bonds and fund parties anomalously. While the identity of the donor is captured, it is not revealed to the party or public. So transparency is not enhanced for the voter. 

No doubt, The denomination has removed dirty money from the market. Now, political parties do not have access to hoarded money to fund their election just like before. In a country like India, where a good part of population is ready to sell their vote for money due to their ignorance or lack of knowledge, this is a big blow to opposing parties like congress. 

The Aadhaar became a surveillance tool for the govt. The NDA govt had amended the 2010 Aadhaar act with some scary stuff last year. Source : https://thewire.in/118655/hello-aadhaar-goodbye-privacy/

Now there are 22 mandatory notification for **voluntary** Aadhaar in this year.  Source : https://thewire.in/115125/aadhaar-timeline-mandatory-notifications/

The recent financial bill gave more (read ultimate) power to tax wing. They can inspect and seize anything they want, wherever they want and whenever they want now. 

You may ask all this are good, right? 

Maybe not. 

For example,take the example of The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015 . The penalty for nondisclosure of foreign income or assets would be equal to three times the amount of tax payable, in addition to tax payable at 30%. But if you want to get out of the hook, buy an electoral bond and bribe the party in position. The govt has guaranteed the anonymity of the donor. Sure, the issuing bank has the data of the buyer, but since all national banks are coming under a single roof under government, the promise of anonymity and receiver not knowing about the name of donor, the banks, donor and parties are safe in the bribing process. 

And, if someone want to protest against all these, be careful , you are naked in front of the govt. All your data, your financial, assets, tele identity, everything is there in front of them. What they have to do is just pull a bizarre thing like porn, torrent downloads etc into paper and screw you. Or they can seek the help of the funded medias and shame you in front of public. 

The govt. has already said that privacy is not a fundamental rights. We are losing our faith in judiciary anyway. Here is more info on mass surveillance in India. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_India 

Oh, did I forgot to tell you that babus can no longer speak against the govt? http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rules-framed-civil-servants-not-allowed-to-criticise-govt-on-social-media/story-FVEtcWbAvsM7NjmPgPqgQK.html 

India is soon going to be like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_(film) . Opposition and the elite can do nothing because they have to hide their own arse. When the lion feed on wolves, the wolves should feed on chickens. 

If you think that **if you are good all is good** , it is time to think again. We all are not ""good"" in every eyes.

I have also flunked in few subjects in my 5th sem for which I am busy giving re-exams so I'm not able to focus on admissions and before I realised the last date for admission has already passed for most of the colleges across India. The only hopes I have are with MS university Baroda (where I did my B.Com Honours) where I am sure to get admission but it's not very reputable. Or Indian School of Business and Finance Delhi where the admissions are still open. But the problem with ISBF is that they are only offering PG diploma courses (1 year courses) and the fees are expensive af (2.5k admission fee and 5.1 lakh annual fee for just one year). Also there is a lot of competition for admission and I have to give an entrance test and personal interview. My options seem to be shrinking by the minute and I don't know what to do. My parents are dead against me taking a year's gap and bugging me night and day for flunking in my 5th sem exam. What I need is genuine advice and a little support, something am not getting at all.

Defence Wrap - Week of 14-19 March 2017,10,61m3bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/61m3bn/defence_wrap_week_of_1419_march_2017/,2,1490570902,"**Challenges ahead of the new Defense Minister**

* Mr. Manohar Parrikar stepped down as the Defense Minister on Mar‐13 to be sworn‐in as the Goa CM on Mar‐14. Same day Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley took additional charge of the Defense Ministry.

* Rumor mills even indicate that this is a stop‐gap arrangement and soon we could see a new Defense Minister, as handling 2 key ministries would be very challenging.

* Outgoing Defense Minister resolved issues like, One Rank One Pension (OROP), rolled‐out DPP, 2016 (addressed some of the Defense procurement issues with a view to encourage private sector participation), made policy changes to encourage MSME participation in the sector.

* Policy framework to encourage private sector participation, simplification of procurement procedures were based on recommendations of committee’s set‐up by him.

* However, with new Defense Minister taking the helm of affairs, we sense the key challenge would be to take forward unfinished work by the outgoing Defense minister at the earliest.

* The ‘Make in India’ is yet to kick off, as many private players having heavily invested in the sector are awaiting on the sideways to take on government orders for ships, helicopters and land systems.

* These projects are likely to be awarded under the ‘Strategic Partnership’ policy. For over 12 months, private sector has been asking for the award of such platform projects on competitive basis, whereas government wants to select private company for a long‐term 'guaranteed work' period.

* This difference of opinion has been a long bone of contention between the industry and Defense Ministry. The new Defense Ministry has to address this big issue as private sector has been long waiting with patience.

**OFB to get order for 155mm shells from UAE**

* India had signed Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) with UAE government on Jan 25, 2017. As part of CSP (which includes areas Defense & Security) deals from Air & Naval Defense were expected to be signed sooner.

* Media reports indicate that Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) is close to bagging an order to make 155mm extended bore full range shells of boat‐tail version, which are used in Bofors‐type Artillery guns (with over 35 kms range) for UAE. Once UAE made the proposal to India in last week of Feb‐2017, India signed the agreement and UAE on its part is yet to sign the documents.

* Since the Jan 25, 2017 meeting, following are some of the key agreements signed,

 * Offshore Patrol vessels and Frigates/Corvettes (UAE has been buying them from USA, Europe),

 * supply Interceptor boats developed by L&T & Private players,

 * 100 SPAD guns project to L&T in partnership with Korean company (project to cost ~Rs 9‐10 bn).
 * Also, RDEL signed strategic MoU with Emirates Defense Industries Company (UAE based integrated defense company).

* OFB bagging this project would give major fillip to them as they have been majorly dependent on IA for their orders. OFB makes 2 versions of shells, boat‐tail and base‐bleed versions.

* Boattail version is an older version and OFB has expertise in making indigenously this variant of shell. These shells are likely to be made at OFB’s Nagpur, Chandrapur and Bhandara plants.

* OFB to‐date has exported 50‐odd products (like Brake parachutes for Su30 & MiG‐29 Fighters, 91mm TRA gun for Navy, Small caliber Ammunition, Prahari‐ the 12.7 Air Defense Gun) to countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, USA and Germany.

* On being awarded this Rs 2.35bn project, OFB’s exports order‐book will zoom‐up 10x (currently exports from OFB are in Rs200‐500mn range).
* We see this development to be very positive, as this is in line with our ex‐Defense Minister’s vision to promote India as Defense export hub. Ex‐Defense Minister had set $2 bn of Defense exports target from India for next 2 years. Growing ties with Mauritius, UAE, Vietnam and Myanmar indicate that Indian Defense eco‐system is working towards achievement of the $2bn Defense exports target.

**Update on Indo‐Russian delegates meet**

* On Mar 17‐18 both, Indian and Russian Defense ministries and corporate representatives met to discuss possibilities of manufacturing spare parts and ammunition for Russian origin Aircraft and Military platforms.
* India and Russia signed 2 Long‐Term Service Agreements (LTSA) for new spares delivery schedule from Russia, a logistics hub in Bangalore and domestic manufacturing of parts by HAL for 200 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, which in future would exceed to 270 Aircrafts. As per agreement, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and United Engine Corporation (UEC) will render technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years worth $300mn.
* The pacts were signed between HAL and the 2 Russian companies. UAC has acquired the right to supply spare parts and do the repair and servicing of the Aircraft it delivered earlier in Dec‐ 2016 only.
* UAC also signed an agreement with HAL to provide lifecycle support and maintenance for Mi‐17 helicopters, MiG‐29K fighter jet, T‐90 tanks and INS Vikramaditya Aircraft Carrier.
* On the sidelines of an event, Russian Trade and Industry Minister, Denis Manturov revealed that M&M subsidiary is working closely in creating the interiors for Sukhoi Super Jet. Russia is negotiating with M&M on MC‐21 Aircraft, a civil aviation project, which is soon to have its maiden flight soon. Also, Russia is negotiating with M&M and other private players to manufacture components for another project 2114 (a Commercial Aircraft project).
* Another Russian official confirmed that an agreement is soon to be finalized for the supply of 60 Multi‐purpose Kazan Helicopters under Phase‐I, whereas, joint facilities would be set up in India to manufacture another 140 helicopters.
* >60% of Indian Defense Equipment platforms procured since 1960’s are of Russian origin. The current serviceability rate of the IAF and IN fleet is <50% owing to lack of spares.
* We view deals between HAL and 2 Russian companies to be big positive, as IAF would now find ease in the procurement of spares from HAL. In 2014, the serviceability rates of Su‐30MKI fighter jets were at 46%. However, post setting‐up the Rs 4 bn after sales service centre for both, Su‐30MKI fighter jets & Helicopters, the serviceability rates have increased to 60%. In other words, it means that of the total fleet size of ~230 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, ~138 of them are ready for missions at any given time.
* MoD some time back had set an ardent task of increasing the serviceability rate to ~75% levels.
* This is in‐line with MoD’s strategy to bring the entire IAF Fighter Jet fleet to global serviceability standard of ~75% levels. This could be gauged from the recent Rafale deal signed, where the French government has promised India, that Rafale will ensure 75% serviceability rate. Also, steep penalties have been imposed if timelines are not adhered.
* We see the 2 agreements between HAL and the Russian companies for technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years to be in‐line with MoD’s strategy to further improve the serviceability rate of the Su‐30MKI Fighter Jet fleet.
* As a result of this initiative, we expect (1) spares cost (on per unit basis) to decline, and (2) DPSU’s and smaller unlisted players to benefit.
* Also, we see positive development from M&M subsidiaries point of view, as the much awaited uptick in their Aerospace business kick‐in. However, we see some meaningful contribution from the Russian side of Aerospace to be seen from FY2018 onwards only.
* Lastly, proposed JV for manufacture of Kazan Ka‐226T was an inter‐governmental agreement
* Signed in Dec‐2015, between Russian Helicopters, JSC Rosoboronexport & HAL. This agreement
assures localization of the production and supply of 200 Light Multi‐role Ka‐226T over a period
of 9 years. First 60 helicopters of them will be produced in Russia, while the remaining 140
helicopters will be produced in India.
* On a whole, this Indian‐Russian delegates meeting concluded with 2 deals signed and making way for few more in the pipeline.

**Lakshya‐II tested successfully**

* IAF successfully test‐flew the Advanced version of Pilot‐less Target Aircraft (PTA) Lakshya‐II on Mar‐15 from the Integrated Test Range off at Odisha coast.
* During the 30 minute flight, this PTA was made to dive at different altitudes, demonstrate various technologies and subsystems including software correction.
* This PTA has a sub‐sonic and re‐usable aerial target system, is remote controlled from ground and designed to impart training to both air‐borne and air‐defense pilots.
* It’s required to evaluate and develop trials of new surface‐to‐air and air to‐air weapon systems.
The test was carried out to check the validity of its engine and duration enhancement.
* Lakshya‐II is designed and developed by Bangalore‐based Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), a DRDO lab.

*About Lakshya Project: 
Lakshya is a reclaimable Aerial target system designed to train guns, missile crews, Air defence pilots in order to engage the targets. Powered by gas turbine engines, it is designed to be launched from land or sea through a 0‐length launcher and can be recovered by a dual‐stage parachute system. Lakshya has been designed to be reused for 15 missions.*

* Since its first test in 2012, all tests done to‐date have been successful. Still we expect induction of Lakshya‐II in to IAF would take few more quarters as few more tests are to be done.
* HAL is only company in India currently producing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) like PTA’s.
* To‐date HAL has made 39 of Lakshya‐I at its Aircraft division, Bangalore. Of this, ~23 of them have been inducted in to IAF, IN.
* In Feb‐2015, MoD approved DRDO proposal for transfer of technology (ToT) to L&T for commercial production of Lakshya. For every Lakshya produced and commercially sold, L&T would have to pay royalty to DRDO. L&T and Tata’s have been associated with Lakshya projects since very long time. L&T produced the Launcher for the IA version and Tata’s produced the Launcher for the IAF version.
* We are of view that L&T and DRDO have already worked jointly to build the production model for Lakshya‐II.
* Also, countries like, Israel, Singapore, Malaysia in the past have shown interest to acquire Lakshya. Even though no order has been made to‐date, there exists possibility of exporting Lakshya (with MoD approval).
* On a whole, induction of Lakshya‐II in to Indian Armed Forces would be positive for companies like, HAL, L&T and Tata’s, which have been involved at different stages of manufacturing Lakshya.

**OFB to produce Mango Shells for T‐90 Main Battle Tanks**

* Tecmash, a Rostec group company announced transfer of the main part of equipment needed to OFB for enabling production of Mango Shells for T‐90 tanks in India.
* Tecmash also finished training Indian specialists for the production of Mango shells.
* Mango shells are feathered armor‐piercing projectiles for 125 mm caliber tank guns.
* Production of the shells was launched in the USSR in 1983 and put into service in 1986.
* This development comes in the back‐drop of a contract to supply 66,000 Mango Shells was signed with India in 2014 worth $ 470mn.
* We view this to be positive development as it adds one more feather to OFB’s capabilities to make Mango Shells, which are used by T‐90 Tanks. Given that the final batch of these Mango Shells was delivered recently, we do not see a large ticket awarding for these Mango shells by IA in the next 3‐6 months at least.


**IAF to get 6 new C‐130J S with Terrain Warning System**

* As per solicitation posted by US Air Force on US Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps), IAF is to get 6 new Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS). This subscription will run for 40 months starting 31 May‐ 2017 through till 31 Aug‐2020.
* Responses for this solicitation are to be submitted by Mar‐30, 2017.
* IAF currently fields 4 C‐130Js, having ordered 6 of them in 2008 (as 2 of them met accidents).
* These 6 Aircrafts that are being solicited were contracted in Dec‐2013 for $ 1.1 bn.
* As with the current fleet, these Aircraft are to be fitted with defensive aids, Indian‐specific communication systems, and chin‐mounted electro‐optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turrets.
* Solicitation to get the new 6 Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) indicates that government is focused to spend on Aircraft safety. TAWS are being deployed globally to prevent the occurrence of any accidents.
* It is after 2 of the C‐130J Hercules got damaged in 2014 & 2017 MoD took the decision to equip TAWS in to these 6 new Military Transport Aircrafts to avoid any further accidents.
* On a whole, we see this to be a positive development for the IAF fleet.

Since so many people called me out for making up shit I will simply quote from articles this time.


Creation of money by the banks

> The Credit Market Funnel

> Suppose the U.S. Treasury prints up $10 billion in new bills, and the Federal Reserve credits an additional $90 billion in readily liquefiable accounts. At first, it might seem like the economy just received a monetary influx of $100 billion, but that is actually only a very small percentage of the actual money creation.
> 
> This is because of the role of banks and other lending institutions that receive new money. Nearly all of that extra $100 billion enters banking reserves. Banks don't just sit on all of that money, even though the Fed now pays them 0.25% interest to just park the money with the Fed Bank. Most of it is loaned out to governments, businesses and private individuals.
> 
> The credit markets have become a funnel for money distribution. **However, in a fractional reserve banking system, new loans actually create even more new money. With a legally required reserve ratio of 10%, the new $100 billion in bank reserves could potentially result in a nominal monetary increase of $1 trillion.**

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp

India uses the same system overall but the multiplier is higher.


> Every one rupee of central bank money in India is able to generate around 6 rupees of money supply in the economy. India’s ratio remains lower than that of Europe, but higher than that of the US.

**NPAs in India**

> Public sector banks (PSBs), which accounted for 90 percent of the total gross NPAs of the banking sector, has seen their gross NPAs jumping past Rs 7 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter. In the past seven quarters, it jumped by Rs 4.18 lakh crore or 133 percent to Rs 7.33 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter from Rs 3.14 lakh crore in September 2015 quarter.

http://www.firstpost.com/business/bad-loans-of-indian-banks-cross-rs-800000-cr-banking-mess-explained-in-7-charts-3939999.html


> Public Sector Banks' Gross Non-Performing Assets Hit 9.83%. In FY16
> Gross NPAs of private sector banks were Rs. 48,380 crore, meaning just 2.70 per cent of gross advances of Rs. 17,91,681 crore during the fiscal 2015-16.

http://profit.ndtv.com/news/banking-finance/article-public-sector-banks-gross-non-performing-assets-hit-9-83-in-fy16-1655760

> For example, in the steel sector, Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel have an exposure of close to Rs 1 lakh crore. Other large stressed companies - Jaypee, Lanco, Videocon, and GMR jointly owe over Rs 3 lakh crore to the banking system. Most of them got into non-core activities like real estate which guzzled up the borrowings, resulting in losses and defaults to banks.

http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-centre-identifies-50-large-npas-for-resolution-under-new-ordinance-2430489

> State Bank of India topped the list of banks with wilful defaulters with Rs 15,069 crore stuck in 997 accounts of borrowers, recording a rise of Rs 2,759 crore in fiscal 2017. Punjab National Bank was second with wilful defaults of Rs 10,989 crore in 871 accounts. Bank of Baroda’s wilful defaults soared from Rs 1,367 crore in the year ended March 2016 to Rs 4,785 crore by March 2017.

> Recently, finance minister Arun Jaitley candidly admitted that the bad loan problem was largely confined to some 50 large corporate groups who had indiscriminately borrowed from banks to set up steel and infrastructure projects, especially in the power sector. **These groups alone would account for over 80% of the total NPAs and stressed assets in the banking system.** Latest data shows that the total NPAs and stressed assets are in the range of Rs 13 lakh crore to Rs 14 lakh crore. **And these are politically, well connected corporate families who dominate election funding.**


-
> Overall, the story is one of the taxpayer bailing out the banks and defaulting corporate groups whose promoters will still end up laughing all the way to the bank.

Somewhat of an opinion piece but read out of it what you want.


Based on all the quotes above I want to ask a few questions, why did the government still decide to recapitalize using public money? Why isn't divestment of SBI and PSU banks on the table? 

Doesn't pumping more public money mean doing the same mistake all over again? All the NPAs were given to political friends of Congress around 2009 or so. 

Now without substantial changes big loans will be given to political friends of BJP and it is very likely that the loans will become NPAs some 10 years or so from now.",6
How do you deal with tough financial situations in family?,10,3bm6ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3bm6ik/how_do_you_deal_with_tough_financial_situations/,16,1435687258,"I hate to discuss this but my family is fucked up in terms of finances. My dad owns one running business and holds properties across about 5-10 Cr, mostly farm lands. 

Elder brother is 33 and college-dropout, has 3 children and has been failing in both business and politics with constant record since past 14 years. He has started over 10 businesses over period of time, all after convincing/pressurizing my father to invest into it and he keeps failing. His failed business ventures have costed family at least 5 Cr loss over period of time. Dad pays for his daily expenses, including his 3 children and wife. Now you may think of kicking out such people out of house if you are young, but you have to understand it's no more practical. He has 3 little kids, and a wife who though supports him but inside regrets marrying this loser but can't even complain since this was their ahaa love-marriage. 

Now I do my little shit and keep my finances separate from them. But that does not help. Elder brother keeps taking money from me ( he's around 10 years elder). And in most cases I'm unable to refuse because I'm still not comfortable telling no to people ( you can call me yes-man), and if I don't give him, and expenses have to be met, so he'll only go to dad's business and take money. So this way sort of I help dad share the burden.

But now I've even started hating dad. He said I should take a FD in his bank because it offers better interest ( it didn't) but then he convinced me, it will help him show good will there and what not and his credit limited would be extended etc etc. Then yesterday was FD maturity day and I'm simply told my money was taken for some equipment at his business. NO FUCKING EXPLANATION and its told like I shouldn't mind it. I didn't react because I know I'm never seeing that money again. If I talk loud, I'll see a sad face as to how he is old and how he supports my elder brother's family etc etc.

Now I'm sitting here raging in anger. How do you guys deal such situations?? I know I should move out so please don't tell me that.",6
