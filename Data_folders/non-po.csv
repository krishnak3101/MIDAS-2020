India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

[Non-Political] Vodafone had been extorting my balance for the past 2 months and blocking my calls to their customer care number.,21,6t66al,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6t66al/nonpolitical_vodafone_had_been_extorting_my/,15,1502536614,"So for the past 2 months Vodafone has been tormenting me. Last month there was a series of deductions from my balance amount for the so called VAS, none for which I have requested. Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles?

I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.

He works as a wedding photographer and an animator. I believe that there has been a lull in the level of talent that has been appearing on the indie scene much of it due to a lack of exposure. This guy does it all, he can play the ukelele, sing different genres ( he sang young the giant, he rapped, and he sang raggae), and most of all he knew how to work the crowd. I am genuinely happy that such talent exists in our country. ",1

These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

I work at an American tech company (Indian coworkers not surprising). I'm pretty sure she is Indian Indian (not American Indian) based on her style of dress -- so very likely either she moved here for a job or went to grad school here and accepted a job here and stayed (which seems to be a common scenario amongst many Indian tech workers).

She does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room, drinks water from a new cup, then throws it into the trash (somewhat dramatically) -- wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup that's only had water in it. (Which I consider very wasteful -- it's a styrofoam cup and it's non-biodegradable). It seems a little unusual, but I’m not sure, it could be normal behavior where she comes from.

Though…

My feelings certainly wouldn't be hurt if she wasn't interested. The only reason why I feel the need to approach is because when I first started working at this company there was a lot of eye contact (her fault -- my fault -- IDK). And I have been getting the distinctive feeling that she'd like me to talk to her (though I'm not really sure).

So, what's an acceptable way to start a conversation with an Indian women? From reading about India on reddit and elsewhere, I've heard the culture is very chauvinistic, and that women shouldn't walk alone at night, and that generally woman are off limits in most cases. I’ve heard this from both non-Indians and Indians. And also heard that relationships between men and woman are usually arranged by their parents (and I think Gandhi practiced this, though I don't think it's common practice today) – and so maybe this is why there are no acceptable ways of approaching females.

I’m not trying to be offensive and I don’t’ mean to sound ignorant – but I feel like this is the only way to really gather acceptable cultural practices – through word-of-mouth and anecdotal, folk experiences. 

I'm only asking what's an acceptable way of approaching (as in starting a conversation) with an Indian female -- that could possibly be romantic in nature (I hate saying this..), but without any possibility of coming of as offensive, or as harassment, or in anyway seeming as ""negative"" in intentions.",1

You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

In India, it takes a lot of guts to take up what you love and pursue it as a career because our parents love us too much to make some risky decisions. 

I am 21 years old now all I did was to follow the path showed by my parents. I never got to know what I love because I didn't there were many options in this world. All I knew was if you want to live a life decently you have to do an engineering job and get a job in a government organisation. 

Engineering opens your doors to the world it shows the all those things you left behind. It starts throwing things at your face saying ""You could have been a lawyer, you could have been an artist, you could have been an artist, blah blah"".With all these revelations about the world, I continued my engineering. I broke my heart, I became a writer, I became a poet, I tried everything in the last 3 years but I couldn't find something which I can hold on to or I can pursue it as a career. Engineering has something for me, it took time but it finally entered into my lazy life.

It took me off my legs, I suddenly felt this is something I can fight for, this is something I can think about all the time, this is the something for which I can wake up at sleep at 5 am daily, this was something I could do all the day and not get bored. 

I started working for The Monologue, NO NO, I don't work for The Monologue, it is something more than it. The Monologue is a platform for storytellers, poets and musicians in Gujarat, India. We are just a group of 7 engineers who have been working in and out al the day just one goal to become the best at what we do. One day I hope that we become the best at what we do.

Most of our parents don't know what we are doing or don't feel that it is a potential career to pursue to live a decent life. I hope one day we prove them wrong too.  

I told you this story because I am the guy who looks after the marketing of The Monologue. I stumbled upon a seminar of Seth Godin(I totally love his ideas on how the world and marketing should be) which can totally turn around the way I see things BUT that costs $745(huge money for an engineering student studying in India). So, I thought maybe someone can help with that kind of, but it doesn't matter now(You read this story that is enough for me). just follow us on Facebook or Instagram search for "" Themonologuein"" that will mean the world to me.

Those who oppose, state your reasons in civil manner. Please maintain peaceful conversations at any cost.
Upvote or down vote depending on quality of comment. Not for opinions.

Edit: down vote for post? Why?? Cause it opposes your opinion? Shame on those narrow-minded people.


Edit: support for **meat** ban. Not only *beef*.


**edit**:

People think its religious and all. It may be religious to some people. But those people are more cruel than those who eat meat. Because they are trying to ban because their religious law contradict but not because to save them. Without this **compassion** how can one religion can be stated as good religion??

Live and let live!

It tastes good doesn't mean you should eat it. I have heard, human meat also tastes good!

[Non-Political] Update: Udta Punjab - CBFC issue.,5,4n477u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n477u/nonpolitical_update_udta_punjab_cbfc_issue/,6,1465407405,"The issue has just taken an interesting turn. 

1. Anurag Kashyap (AK) had apparently alleged yesterday that Pahlaj Nihalani (PN) & Co. had not given them their decision including the list of required cuts in writing. PN just said in an interview that AK & Co. were scheduled to collect it yesterday (June 7) morning. However, they did not do so and later in the day went to the media and said that CBFC had not given them the certificate. Now, the same has been collected by them today.

2. AK said that CBFC ordered them to remove 'Punjab' from the film title. PN says they never asked AK & Co. to change the film title and that AK is only doing that for publicity. 

And now for some extremely shoddy reporting from India Today (IT) (which I had some respect for before today):

A. PN specifically said in the interview (which IT showed like a hundred times continuously like every Indian news channel always does) that during his tenure, 72% of the films have been allowed without any cuts. India Today reported that PN claims that CBFC has approved 72% of Udta Punjab.

B. AK had made some wild allegations against PN including stating that he (PN) was a megalomaniac. PN unequivocally stated that he hasn't met AK after Bombay Velvet. IT, grossly twisting this, reports (quoting PN) that PN has NEVER met AK.

Now, yesterday, I was insanely furious against PN & Co. after watching my favourite director's (AK, not PN) passionate appeal in the interview. However, if I had watched only IT reports without having seen the interview, I would be fully pissed and transform into my keyboard-warrior mode against PN & Co. However, the shoddy reporting by IT makes me a bit skeptical about how much of this whole story, as portrayed by AK & Co. and the reporting by IT (usually), is exactly as true as they say it is.",1

As someone who grew up in the nineties and the 'noughties', very little was taught about the events of the 70s onwards. Also, we were fed the image of Manmohan Singh being the saviour of the modern Indian economy with no arguments against it which is something I'd like to explore along with madness of the emergency or the NDA debacle in the late nineties or the UPA madness last decade.

I'm a South Indian male in Maharashtra and I have applied to Christ College in Banglore (which happens to be my native place, sort of) for a triple major programme (BA PSEng and PSEco) and my interview is on the 13th of May. Now, this is the only place where I applied, so not getting in will be difficult even though I'm quite confident that I'll get in.

I come from a reputed school and junior college (Smt. Sulochanadevi Singhania School) with what I consider sub-par marks (64% average in 11th, which is the marksheet I had to submit) and I need some help with this interview, especially from someone who has hopefully gone through the same process before.

Now I don't know anything at all about interviews and I have many questions (how ironic) and I'll be very grateful to have them answered. My questions mainly revolve around a general interview and not ""what questions do they ask"" or something like that. The things that I am sure I have covered are my attire and myself. However, there are things that I doubt very largely.

.


What am I supposed to bring to this sort of interview?

.


If I'm supposed to bring a Portfolio, what should that contain? In what format? I'm absolutely clueless.

.


On a scale of 1 to 10, how much can I ""brag""? 1 being ""I am educated"" and 10 being listing all my talents, anything I have ever achieved in life, proficiency in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, etc.

.


How do I convey that I am more than that piece of paper? How much should I keep to myself?

.


I'm not too artsy, so how fancy should my portfolio look? Is a simple, plain, printed text sheet enough? (I'm really good at editing though, so I can handle digital stuff well)

.


How much weightage do my board marks carry? I scored well in 10th and stayed afloat in 11th and 12th. I'm hoping that my 12th boards will be reflective of my intellectual value, so I'd also like to know which standard is looked at more specifically or if it's looked at as a learning curve.

.


I might ask more questions later, so I'd love it if you could answer. Nonetheless, thank you so much for reading this anyway.",1

The real life issues of  reactions of different family members, difference in opinions, some compromises in traditional value, concerns of extended family and how they come about to achieve a middle ground none of which was  depicted in a proper way. It was borderline racist sometimes without being apologetic even when there was absolutely no requirement for scenes like that. And no, that never increased the humor quotient of the movie which was already as low as the film maker's standards.  To summarize, it  was as if a hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns  as gifts because they are from Texas.

I'm writing an analysis on India's media industry (for an International Marketing class) and wanted to get some pointers on where to start: The purpose of my paper is to basically dissect the industry and then make hypothetical recommendations to a company currently operating in the country. Some of the subtopics I am most curious about are:

1) radio broadcast in India (popularity/demographics of listeners, types of shows, are they generally profitable? Does the Indian listener prefer Desi music or a wider variety?)

2) music industry: It is common knowledge that the most popular music is likely associated to Bollywood, but I wanted to know if there was an independent music culture as well? How do musicians typically make music outside of the film industry?

3) what kinds of TV shows are most popular? What American shows are popular in India? Are soaps/serials popular amongst the youth? How is Aamir Khan's satyamev jayate amongst the youth? Are there other similar shows as such?

4) Networks: what are some of the powerhouse network companies? what networks are popular amongst young adults?

5) News. how do young adults get their information in India? what news channels are popular/reliable?

6) Do young folk read the newspapers?

If there's anything you personally find interesting about the industry, I would love to hear it! Thanks for the help, this is the brainstorming session for what I hope becomes an interesting paper. Thanks in advance!

I contacted Amazon about the issues I’ve had with Bluedart and how I was going to end up disappointed with my first Amazon.in purchase. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a reply in a few hours (way before their 24 hour wait period for emails). They promised me that the couriering will complete in time and they will prevent any such issues from happening again.

I ended up getting two Bluedart and one Fedex package in the next couple days. This is the *first time* that Bluedart has been able to “find” my address, LOL!

Let me also add, this Amazon email I got as a reply was one of those rare customer service emails that didn't sound self-defensive but really genuine and helpful—when something wrong was pointed out against the company.

Thanks for your thoughts in the previous post, guys.

The venture specializes mostly in the San Francisco and East bay real estate markets and only deals in commercial property. Hotels, Office spaces, Apartment complexes and such. The company itself is registered in the State of California.

My question is, do I have any advantages to investing in that market? Taxwise, do I have any benefits when I repatriate the profits back to India? Most importantly will my money grow? The US has low inflation comparatively, so that should help. But am I missing something?

Escuse me for bothering you with a travel related question. Furthermore I understand that some of you are tired of 'westeners in yoga pants'. Please understand that I am not visiting your country out of an idea that you are nothing more than a spritual country.

With this said I am seeking your advice.

I am an european male travelling to India in about a month time. I have heard many good stories from friends who have been in your country. I will be in India for about 6 months (October - April) I think. If money and desire suffices.

I want to experience India as a country; culture, food, people etc. But one of my main plans is to find a good place for yoga. Ideally I would find an ashram where I could stay for 2-3 months. Maybe, if it's possible I would like to do a teacher training course, mainly because I want to deepen my own practice but maybe, some day, I could be interested in teaching.

BUT when I try to find places online it is really hard to determine the quality of the courses and, of course, I do not like being ripped of/wasting my time.

As I understand there are many places in India for yoga. Rishikesh, Varanasi, Mysore are the main ones that I have come upon.

I almost decided on not booking anything in advance and then travelling to a yoga city to find a course.

In this regard, do you have any advice? Cities? Specific ashrams? Ways to approach this?

I have tried in /r/yoga . I have tried different yoga forums. I have tried google. All without much result.

I really appreciate your help.",1

"Hinduism, conversion and the neutrality of the Indian Secular State: a non-political, theological exploration",0,2qlsrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2qlsrb/hinduism_conversion_and_the_neutrality_of_the/,9,1419784511,"tl;dr:

* Pagan traditions and Semitic religions are fundamentally different manifestations of religiosity. 

*  Traditions are difficult to proselytize because they do not consider other traditions as false. 

* Semitic religions believe that some religions are indeed false and so encourage and facilitate conversion. 

* The Indian state sees Hinduism as just another semitic religion. 

* The Indian state by allowing conversion is working within a Christian theological framework. It is not being neutral.  



Full length:

In India, we have two different kinds of religions: Pagan or Dharmic or Indic traditions (Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions) and Semitic or Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity). 

Hindu traditions exist because they are passed down from one generation to the other. Such traditions do not actively seek converts because they do not entertain the notion that other people follow false gods or have false religions. 

Such traditions see things like devas or puja pr bhakti as familial or traditional practices. They are followed in order to maintain some continuity between different generations, not because they contain some grand and timeless truth. The practioners of such traditions might try to justify their actions (a Durga bhakt would say that she is worshiped because she killed a powerful demon).  Such justifications are mostly offered to outsiders (non-bhakts or non-hindus) and are not theologically consistent. 

Observing ancestral practices need not be justified logically just as there is nothing logical about writing a sonnet using just 14 lines. Why 14? Its just tradition. There is nothing scientific or logical about it. 

 Semitic religions (namely Islam and Christianity) spread partly as ancestral practices and partly through conversion.

 Islamic and Christian theologians try (not always successfully of course) to be logically consistent because they  think that they are after some grand and timeless truth. Using the God-given faculty of Reason, they want to understand the nature of Creation and the Creator. Conversion makes sense to Muslims and Christians because they think there are false religions and false gods. And the people who worship such false gods will be punished after they die by the True God. To save the “heathen”, Muslims and Christians are encouraged to engage in proselytization and conversion. 

The heathen needs to be saved from his own spiritual blindness.
 

Indian secularism is defined as equal respect and equidistance from all religions. The secular state sees Hinduism as just another Semitic religion with an internally consistent theology containing a singular grand Truth. So a Brahmin is just another kind of Priest, and Gita another kind of “religious” text like the Quran. Having confused tradition with religion, the Indian state allows for proselytization thinking that it is possible to convert people from one tradition to the other. 


By allowing proselytization and conversion, the Indian state has accepted that:

1.	There are some True gods and some False  gods.
2.	It is possible and necessary and understandable that people can be “saved” from eternal damnation for worshiping false gods. 
3.	Hindu traditions can compete financially and theologically in the “marketplace of damned souls” on a level footing with Islam and Christianity.
  
None of the above statements holds up to  **neutral scientific scrutiny** . Do humans have souls? Can souls be damned? Are there True and False gods? Do Islam and Christianity contain some timeless truth? 

Within the framework of Hindu “theology”, the notions that there are false gods and that you can be punished for worshiping such goads do not make sense.

However, all of the above statements make sense within the framework of Christian theology. 

Faced with two completely contradictory theoretical positions (there are some false gods and there are no false gods), the Indian state cannot be neutral. It either allows conversion (as it has done for the past 60yrs) and accepts the semitic notion of false gods, heathens etc or it bans conversion and gives undue advantage to pagan traditions. 

Faced with two very different kinds of religions, the Indian state cannot afford to be equidistant or show equal respect.

[Non-Political] Why shouldn't Indian response to current stereotyping controversy called hypocrite? hypocrite for India to,2,2yjt9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2yjt9k/nonpolitical_why_shouldnt_indian_response_to/,10,1426018010,"After all, most of the Indians who are outraged over the world stereotyping 'Indian men' were ok and lots of time have even used 'All mulsims are not terrorist, but all terrorists are muslim' logic.
There IS a problem with attitude towards women in our country. Like US has racist cops, Pakistan and other muslim countries have extremists, Africa (Yes and that's not even a country) is poor and hungry, Westerns have family problems and so on. We never raised questions when muslims had to go strip searches in world's airports just because of their names. 
Rape is a problem in every country but in our country combine it with the years of oppression, female infanticide/foeticide , dowry system and blatant sexism existing in the all of majority religions/cultures (Hinduism, Islam, Jainism) and the 'look in your own backyard' argument gets demolished.
We get overjoyed when foreign scholars/dignitaries praise our culture, scriptures or scientific advancements but accuse them of stereotyping as soon as they point fingers about the problems in our country. Take the Obama's visit for example. 
Whether we accept it or not the truth is that we take great pride in our ancient heritage but brush the problems under the carpet, and when somebody specially from outside world uncovers these problems our egoistical selves start screaming Holier than though and Racist!!",1
