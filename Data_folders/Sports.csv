Does India have a similar system for interscholastic athletics?

* It's not cricket. Non-cricket sports have generally not been broadcast unless super important
* It's women's game. Great to see women's matches being broadcast.
* It's U17. It's not even the top level side.
* It's a domestic match. It's not some FIFA WC Qualifier.

Other than that, more domestic cricket matches are being streamed now. Today a few SMA trophy matches were streamed and an U19 match vs Nepal was streamed.

Hockey Olympic qualifiers were also streamed, for both men and women.

Tablighi Jamaat & Covid,24,ftltyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/,7,1585860887,"It was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.",7

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

2019 in Indian Books: Discussion Post,254,eq9r3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eq9r3q/2019_in_indian_books_discussion_post/,67,1579339183,"Last year I made a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aa9wgq/2018_in_indian_books_discussion_post/) like this about books in 2018: here's one for 2019 as well. I've made separate comments for different categories, listing notable books published in 2019. This is not a comprehensive list and it is subjective. I haven't read all the books on it, but you can probably tell from the summaries if I have. Recommendations are welcome.

Why isn’t scholastic wrestling not a part of extra curriculum in Indian Schools despite wrestling being a popular sport in Indian culture?,17,dnq7jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dnq7jf/why_isnt_scholastic_wrestling_not_a_part_of_extra/,5,1572190064,"Wrestling or kushti in hindi seems to be one of the most popular indian sports and martial art of India.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

Is it regarding attractiveness? Theres no shortage of bombshells in india, especially given the population. I would really love our beautiful brown women to take up this sport. Its a well respected sport in many developed countries.

I seriously dont get it lol. Why bring girls all the way from europe and north america?

I'm 25, earning 60k, and it's not that I'm dumb or something but sometimes I feel how to feel. My dad's a government officer, mid-fifties, earns more than a lac. He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age.

Hotstar video quality is total crap,152,e006q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e006q5/hotstar_video_quality_is_total_crap/,73,1574453741,"I've got a 100mbps connection which plays Netflix, Prime YouTube at full hd or even 4k (YouTube only) absolutely fine. But Hotstar is a completely different animal. 

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works. 

So, is this problem only with me, or does anyone else see this kind of problems in their phone?

App: Hotstar Android

I don't know. It kind of looks as if Hotstar is trying to save bandwidth costs. Out of all the major streaming apps, Hotstar is the only one without hdr, and it's video bandwidth is already pretty less (pixelations).

I am biased to India’s interests and our positions. I, however, do notice how EU has helped the nations like Poland to advance on various social, medical and economic indexes. Being like EU may be a distant dream, we sure can come together and push back on the Chinese when they dump our countries with cheap stuff, the Americans when they push defense deals and play active international politics in our region and EU when they target this region around visa policies.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

   * E.g. Judgement on Sardar Sarovar Project
* Increased Accessibility: The Supreme Court was hailed for the “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.
* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

Your thoughts on e-sports,52,bwkqxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwkqxu/your_thoughts_on_esports/,47,1559652669,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course. I feel like my parents are being narrow minded, the person i wanna be is exactly not the person they want me to be. The amount of toxicity that my parents are inflicting upon me is immeasurable.

If you've ever been in this position / have a piece of advice for me, please comment. If you wanna know more about a specific part here, ask me. I'd be happy to elaborate. This is very serious and I'm helpless.",7

PL matches, F1 weekend and ipl matches in that order of preference.
But IPL is being broadcasted on 8 out of 10 channels. I understand it is our national game /s and needs to be shown to gain the money through incessant ads during over breaks and the ""Strategic Timeouts"". But they should have left atleast one more channel for other sports. What do you guys think?",7

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

Are Indians just a cheap commodity to the world,106,dncd9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dncd9w/are_indians_just_a_cheap_commodity_to_the_world/,33,1572115959,"Whilst it's nice to see India represented nicely in the World stage, against the tidal wave of memes about us being Gang Rapists, Street shitters, curry eaters and tribalistic cavemen (I can go on and on big you get the picture)... I feel people look at Indians as a commodity instead of as people. This is a bit of a rant, but I'll elaborate.

For example, before the last Cricket world cup, reddit cricket was awash with a few Footballers and athletes from different sports taking selfies with Indian shirts saying ""I support Team India"".

/Cricket was awash with fawning Indian fans. Granted, I know most will be young fans, but something didn't sit right with me. Its clear that these stars dont even know what cricket is, let alone there is a WC going on.... It was clearly just a PR Strategy. 
The similar thing was done by alot of companies when it comes to Bollywood.

I just found it soooooo patronizing and condescending. They know Indians would eat that shit straight out of their hands. The know quality doesnt mean anything but quantity goes along way. India has a very fad based culture. So consumerism of merchandise is easy $$$ for International companies.

I dont blame the companies, its basic marketing. I just wish Indians would be self aware and appreciate that these people dont give a shit about Indians except our wallets and want us eating out of their hands. We make ourselves look desperate and pathetic.",7
I(21F)Can't decide if my bf(28M) is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough,30,dup4ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dup4ed/i21fcant_decide_if_my_bf28m_is_showing_red_flags/,35,1573486943,"Hey ladies and gentlemen!

I need some urgent advice about my relationship as soon as possible.I've been a member of this subreddit for quite sometime now,and I've noticed you guys giving awesome advice to eachother.

I(21F) met my boyfriend(28M) an year and a half ago.Basically,I signed up on a dating site for the first time ever and deactivated it within 3 days.He saw me on there and found me on facebook.We chatted for a bit and he asked me out.He's met my dad and I've met his mom and we are both serious about getting married in the near future.

So I'm from a South Asian Muslim background and he's from a south asian hindu background.He's not religious at all,I am a bit religious,not too much though,and the religious differences don't bother me a bit.

Last year,my boyfriend/s coworker/female friend had a bad date(she invited a guy to her place,got drunk,he wanted to have sex and she refused,so he left).She asked my bf to hangout with her at 3 am on the same night because she was upset her date left.He told me about this and went to her place,then they went to the beach.I got uncomfortable and asked my bf if I could speak to her.He told me I could message her on fb and I did,politely asking her about what happened that night.She got really upset,made a very racist comment about me to my bf and after replying ""Nothing happened.We just hung out.He's a friend of mine"" blocked me.Then she kept texting my bf to ask how I'm doing(my boyfriend told me).I asked him why he didn't defend me and he said ""I couldn't attack her because she is a girl.I didn't want to make things awkward at office"".

I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.She's still following him on instagram though.

So,here's the thing.Whenever I've brought up any concerns regarding this relationship in the past,my boyfriend has done all he could to ease my mind.Recently,he made a new group of friends he plays sports with every weekend.They're all Indian,so my bf gets along with them really well.They've begun to invite him out to bars and nightclub parties almost every week now.Last weekend,they invited him to a bollywood party at a nightclub in LA.The guys went with their girlfriends,and my bf knew very well I couldn't accompany him since I live at home with my parents and I'm not allowed to go out to clubs and bars until I have my own place.He asked me if I'm okay with it and I told him to go and have fun.He then told me all about how his friends got black out drunk.

Also,Him and a good college friend of his vacationed in las vegas last year for a weekend.Before he left,he kept telling me his friend was going to hire an escort and visit strip clubs(bf said the most he'd do is probably get a lap dance at a strip club just for his friend).They rented a car together and bf told me his friend wants to pick up girls in the ferrari.Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.Once he got back I asked him about his trip and he didn't mention escorts or strip clubs.I asked him about his friend and he said his friend didn't get an escort.

My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.I am very concerned because I honestly don't think this friend is a good influence.I haven't brought this up to my bf yet.

I've just been thinking about this alot lately.Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?Is this lifestyle common for people in the United States?Am I being too conservative/inflexible?

Any advice,or your thoughts,anything at all would really help!

Tl;dr Can't decide if my bf is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough",7

He seems quite optimistic about the move of scrapping Article 370 and 35A, which he hopes will bring prosperity to the region. With the scrapping of the bill, he hopes citizens of J&K will benefit immensely. He raised the following points to the benefit of the people of J&K:

1. State employees of J&K will be awarded same benefits as other state employees like LTCs, HRA, Education allowance, Health insurance, etc., some of which are currently not available to them.
2. Public sector units and private sector units will be encouraged to employ more locals.
3. Government's PM Scholarship scheme will be implemented there asap.
4. Voting rights will be awarded to people who migrated from Pakistan to J&K during partition.
5. The election system will remain the same as earlier where they will elect their own representatives.
6. PM has urged the film industries in India to invest more in J&K.
7. He wishes to give sports a boost in the state by opening new sports academies, new stadiums, and impart science back sports knowledge.

We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Just my two cents!! Join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous India, lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy* by locking up the poor!

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above). 

- Meanwhile the match starts on Aug3 and we all go India...India with ads of Dream 11 and Godaddy after every over, khelo dimag se my friends",7

A guide to anti-particulate masks,56,dpa2c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dpa2c2/a_guide_to_antiparticulate_masks/,18,1572486383,"I live in Gurugram and it's that time of the year when the air's out to kill you. I see very few people using anti-particulate masks around me. Now, I don't know if that recklessness, ignorance, badassery or dumbassery, but I am going to build on a comment I made on an earlier post by /u/UndeniableDork and write a guide to buying an anti-particulate mask. Before I start, resistance or immunity to particulates or pollution isn't a thing. Don't be an unscientific dumbass. Protect yourself and educate people you care about.

Down below are the different categories of masks along with an example Amazon link for the class. I do not endorse any of these products. These are just masks I've used over the last four years living in NCR and I don't have any complaints regarding their effectiveness. All of these, besides the exceptions mentioned, have protected me from breathlessness, irritated throat and upper respiratory tract infection.

1. I see a lot of people using the green surgical masks that are used in hospitals. This **DOES NOT** protect you from particulates. It works for airborne germs and will protect you from that guy who'll sneeze in your face while commuting on metro, but it does little for pollution. Most of the anti-particulate masks listed below help with germs as well, but if you're in an elusive unpolluted town with job opportunities, you can just get these to protect yourself in flu season. Price: [Rs. 5 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Filtra-4-Ply-Loop-Surgical-Face/dp/B00IIIKZK6/)
2. The cheapest anti-particulate masks are disposable ones that are sold in sets of one, three, five or ten. I used 3M, Honeywell and Dettol and they are all fine. I'm partial towards 3M and Honeywell because they have been making these masks and selling them as industrial personal protective equipment for decades now. Also, 3M and Honeywell masks sell well among the residents of other polluted cities around the world. Price: [Rs. 13.5 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/), [Rs. 33.9 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/)
3. The next tier is disposable masks with exhalation valves. The exhalation valves prevent moisture buildup inside the mask keeping is less humid preventing it from getting warm and uncomfortable. 3M and Honeywell sell these masks as well. Depending on the time duration you'd like to wear them and the amount of physical exertion you're likely to undertake, you'll have to get a mask with a single exhalation valve or two exhalation valves. Price: [Rs. 37 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004GV-Particulate-Respirator-Mask/dp/B01LF2QMRQ/), [Rs. 127.8 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-Pollution-Foldable-Exhalation-Valve/dp/B01I9PVOPW/)
4. Then, there are high performance masks like the ones sold at Decathlon. You'll need these if you're planning to jog or cycle in a gas chamber. They also have dual ~~purification~~ exhalation valves ~~which are the main filtration component in the mask~~. The mask itself is reusable, but the purification filter must be replaced when you feel the air flow is getting limited. They admit more air flow than the ones above and they'll let you get more oxygen into your lungs while also blocking out particulates. *I haven't tried these masks and I cannot vouch for their effectiveness.* Price: [Rs. 499 per mask (Mask + Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8398131_sport-mask-light-blue.html#/254-), [Rs. 149 per filter (Replacement Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8397813_sport-mask-light-filter.html)
5. The most expensive ones are pretty looking masks like Vogmask and Cambridge mask that are made of cloth on the outside with a particulate filter inside. They also come with one or two exhalation valves. Some of these can be hand-washed an reused, but not with a detergent. Please remember that detergent fumes are carcinogenic. There are also masks with replaceable filters like the Decathlon one above. Some of these masks come with additional features such as activated carbon filters. These masks generally claim 95-99% efficiency. Price: [Rs. 299 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/PureMe-Reusable-Pollution-Activated-Filters/dp/B07KXMHNL7/), [Rs. 449 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Tdas-Anti-pollutiion-dustproof-Washable-Reusable/dp/B07YCWT6JY/), [Rs. 499 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07NC8DW9Z/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Dettol-Anti-Pollution-Cambridge-Newton/dp/B07JP8RBQ2/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Vogmask-Noir-CV-N99-Large/dp/B01J6KOW62/)
6. Nasofilters are an indigenous (AFAIK) product that is a filter that sits at your nostrils rather than functioning as a mask. So far, I've heard mixed reviews about them. The issue is see with them is that they don't filter air that will enter your respiratory system through your mouth. [Rs. 33 per pair of Nasofilters](https://www.amazon.in/NANOCLEAN-GLOBAL-Nasofilters-Pack-Boxes/dp/B078X6YFC6/)

A mask is only as effective as its fit around your nose and mouth. Honeywell masks, in their product guides, have a good way to test the effectiveness of what your wearing. If your mask is sitting right, it will puff up a bit every time you exhale and collapse a bit every time you inhale.

EDIT: Some corrections regarding high-performance sports masks. If you're looking for a mask for a child or an infant, look for smaller sized masks since adult-sized masks do not fit their faces and can end up causing suffocation for them.

Get an air purifier for your bedroom. Sleep quality improves when the air around you isn't full of shit. If you're unwilling to spend money on an air purifier, you can buy a PM2.5 filter screen for your air-conditioner ([Rs. 350 for a pack of 2](https://www.amazon.in/3M-Non-Woven-Electrostatic-Purifying-Filter/dp/B06XY536LF/)).

TL;DR: Wear an anti-particulate mask, there's a mask for everyone whether you're a broke-ass student or someone who makes 1.6LPM.",7

##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -> physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

[General] What is your opinion about the IITs? Do you think they're worth it?

Basic information is that I've been preparing for JEE Mains exam but some problems have hindered my preparation and plan.

While preparing I couldn't ignore how flawed these institutions are, there's barely any research done, barely any breakthroughs in science, lack of innovation and a lot of it can be attributed to how these institutions take in students, the admission process is biased towards upper middle class and the rich, those who can afford the ridiculously expensive coaching institutions, the coaching culture is a demon in its own way and deserves a thread on its own but I'll keep it as straight and simple as I can. The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it.

I could go on and on about how the system is flawed, how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra-curricular activities, overall creativity, communication and sports.

In conclusion, I don't think they're worth 3-4 years of life the students have to sacrifice in order to get these institutions, the pressure and lack of social interaction.",7
My assessment on Indian Olympics contingent,16,d7lsqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d7lsqd/my_assessment_on_indian_olympics_contingent/,13,1569155785,"I was very excited about India's chances at Rio Olympics but sadly we were very unlucky there. I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders.",7

Are there no centrists in India who are not completely polarised by political ideologies and are objective in assessing & supporting Govts based only on their administration?,10,e9nmtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e9nmtc/are_there_no_centrists_in_india_who_are_not/,5,1576186539,"I am a centrist. An Indian who believes that Govts and political parties are not boyhood football, cricket and other sports teams that you have to be loyal to and support no matter what or oppose no matter what. 

I can praise a party for the right steps they took and criticise the same people for the wrong ones. 

Just like it happens in good corporate cultures. Based on merit & performance. 

No one or no party is bigger than the country and what it good for the future of it's people. Why can't we as citizens start getting more objective in our assessment? The best countries on Earth have the least amount of political polarisation as the people there only want progress. 

For eg. Not everything that a party XYZ has done is correct because you support them and not everything the same party did is wrong is because you loathe them. 

Currently I find it difficult to find like minded people who are objective in their outlook without having to identify themselves rigidly with being completely anti someone or completely pro someone. I feel we can never progress until we come out of this fanboyism. 

This is not an agenda I'm trying to propagate, but perhaps I can be enlightened by some insights on why this happens.",7

Do people get socially / personally alienated because they're not interested / scared of pets?,21,d94q1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d94q1l/do_people_get_socially_personally_alienated/,41,1569453484,"Over the past few months (and over the course of the last couple of years) I have noticed that an not having an overwhelming affection for dogs, cats and all assorted pets is a rather significant factor in maintaining relations with friends and family, dealbreakers when it comes to dating and possibly relations too. 

[ *""i'm a mother / father of 2 doggos""* ; *""if there's a doggo in your pic i'm dating you and stealing that good boi""* ; **the evergreen classic** *""doggos over humans any day...""* ; *""if my cat likes you, only then you have my approval...""* ; the deluge of appreciation tweets & posts on Instagram / Facebook; now the rise in posts in this very sub over the past week and many, many more...]

Dating apps have women and men displaying overwhelming affection for their pets. I've personally been unmatched and (digitally) broken contact with on a couple of occasions because I straight up admitted that i'm not too keen about pets (specifically dogs). 

[that i'm kinda scared of dogs in general due to a childhood mishap with a pet dog is a whole other issue altogether - growing up I've managed to control my fear/worry and while I don't exactly start screaming when in close proximity to a dog, I do look visibly panicked]

i'm not exaggerating when I say a potential marriage alliance was completely nipped in the bud because of the fact that she had a tattoo of her pet dog and I clearly admitted that i'm not a fan of having a pet / pets in the future. My entire existence as a human being and all my joys and sorrows, education, academics, work experience, sporting and personal achievements were instantly invalidated in a flash - because of this viewpoint.

while I clearly and obviously do not have an issue with folks having pets at their homes and the visible rise of pet friendly public spaces. cafes & restaurants - any attempts at trying to meet at non pet presence(d??) places is met with a lot of derision and straight up hostility. 

I understand that folks with pets treat them as nothing short of family members - but their decision to stay away from actual human beings; avoid and have a low opinion of those who are averse to pets - is rather confusing and if I may admit to it - a bit hurtful as well. I've missed out on a couple of social & personal relations because of this and I really do think it rankles.

Bala movie: A mix of new and the old (Analysis),15,du8jny,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/du8jny/bala_movie_a_mix_of_new_and_the_old_analysis/,4,1573400154,"I was expecting nothing from the movie Bala because of majorly 2 things. First, I had checked twitter and found people with negative reviews (well Twitter is negative about everything these days) and secondly I had to walk out of the movie ""Dreamgirl"". I like Ayushmann but I found ""Dreamgirl"" pretty average and the movie felt like a culmination of comedy circus scenes. Thus, I was sceptical.

I was totally wrong. Bala is an Ayushmann khurana trademark movie. Ofcourse the director Amar Kaushik and the entire cast are responsible for the success. But, this movie is not merely about a good script selection. Ayushmann did a marvelous job of a frustrated insecured bald guy. I could relate to his frustration. The portrayal is just too realistic. 

Now, directly coming to the themes the movie touches. (Contains Spoilers)

1. Insecurities - The movie uses Baldness (primarily) and dark complexion as insecurities people have and how the world is hell-bent on shaming them. It sees Baldness and skin tone in a completely different way. Baldness touching the masculine charm and skin colour determining the feminine side. It explores these two ideas. 

Another insecurity it explores is the millennials quest for an enhanced pseudo identity on social media platforms. Bala gets upset about his baldness because he thinks he is not presentable on Instagram and Tiktok. The material socialisation of social media where we long to get likes in our videos, intellectual brainstorming statuses and etc. Yami Gautam's character comes in the frame here as she is a viral star with modeling aspirations.

2. Status quo - Javed Jaffrey remarks in the movie, that looks don't matter for men as it is a patriarchal society and after marriage the girl has to stay with the husband irrespective of her choice cause she is now tied. In the marriage it constantly challenges this notion. Bhumi Pednekar who is herself a lawyer, encourages a women to leave ger husband who was justifying her husband's cheating because of her weight. Yami Gautam files a divorce suit after she finds Bala is bald and has lied to her about his hair. It tries to break away from the marital trap of a women. 

3. Religion - Bollywood has attempted to touch religion in films like PK, OMG! Bala's addressing of religion is inclusive. Initially it criticises Lord Krishna for beautifing a dark toned into a fair skinned girl. In the end it analyses the situation in a completely different way. Krishna was not trying to change her into fair skin, the Lord was trying to make her realise that she is beautiful. This positive interpretation and understanding of India's religious practices is commendable because many a times we associate reformation with total denunciation of religion. India's secularism has always been about plurality and not about separation of church (here religion) from the state.

4. Pop culture

It touches upon the pop culture that shames dark skinned women by mocking certain Bollywood songs. It doesn't resort to any blame game because during that time subtle misogyny was evident everywhere rather it tries to remind us how subconsciously how we have been indoctrinated with the thought that beauty means fair.

5. Staying true to yourself

Both the women lead are true to their archetype. Bhumi although felt upset as a kid when she was shamed for being dark, she doesn't let it affect her way of life. She finds social media irrelevant to project a different self and tries to live her life with her ideals. Yami on the other hand is a product of social media. She is aware of her ""beauty"" appeal and uses that to build a brand around tiktok (just like a modern day influencer). She herself admits that ""externalities"" is her way of life and without that she is nothing. That bedroom scene with Ayushmann was much needed because there's a nerd culture being developed which shames people too much. ( So, what if someone uploads a selfie or a Tiktok video? Can we just mind our won business if we don't like it. If one is self aware of their potential and knows the market, exploiting it through social media is not a sin.) It is still better than the hypocrite Ayushmann who tries to fake it. Yami is not faking it. She is aware of her ""externality"" aspect. 

6. Activism: The best cinematic aspect of Bala is that the movie is not preachy. It is subtle in its activism. It doesn't call any names to direct blame, it highlights the normalisation of practices. Like fairness obsession, body shaming and even new ones like social media's edited reality. It depicts the shallowness of being too filmy. Bala's need for gratification comes from the fact he wants to emulate Bollywood behaviour. 

7. High school nostalgia: Bala tried so hard to have his hair back is because of the appreciation he received in school. A lot of people are stuck in their school days because they had a particular identity in school. Some were good at sports but later ended up in a deadbeat job and in the case of Bala, it being the popular kid in class. People are obsessed with the highschool nostalgia as they want to go back to those days to escape the monotony that employment and real life offers.

The most important point: Is Bala a traditional Bollywood hero? Well, Bala has certain flaws. He is bald which the B'town hero rarely is. He is insecured. Our heroes maybe big time fraud in their films but they are never insecured. Bala is different to a Bollywood hero. Bala doesn't get the girl. He gets rejected by Bhumi as she is in love with someone else. Also, it doesn't follow the Bollywood style of falling in love with the second girl (read rebound) in movies such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hain. Yammi ends up divorcing Bala.

But, but it follows the conventional hero arc in the end. Because the movie is all about Bala's victory over his insecurities. It is about his catharcis which he has in his last ""fairness"" cream presentation. It is about his reversal of fortune from being an average comedian to a well loved one. He follows the athenian ideal hero in a way. (Except he doesn't visit the underground) Bhumi feels sympathetic towards Bala and fights his case (it initially felt like she loves him but benefit of doubt she was fighting for herself as well as she might relate to Bala's baldness in a way as she has suffered societical taunting for her skin tonned)

Bala might have deviated from mainstream Bollywood norms (althout it is itself a commercial movie) but it adheres to the policy of The Indian Hero resurgence.

To conclude, all this analysis holds no value if the movie is boring and Bala is far from that. It is a fun watch.",7

Let’s just say for arguments sake Indians are not genetically athletic however in a sample size of 1.3 billion people you are going to have very large statistical outliers (I also don’t think Indians are not genetically inferior especially north Indians) but why haven’t they been found. China has 2 billion people and has made the most with them.They currently have track runners running 100m times in 9.8s which is enough to medal if not even win the next olympics even if Chinese are not “athletic” in a large sample size there will be elite athletes.

Lifecycle of Indian Male,54,ce06hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce06hm/lifecycle_of_indian_male/,56,1563327030,"Day 1 – You are born. Parents are celebrating that you are male and even more happier if you have fair skin.

&#x200B;

Childhood – You are expected to go with the flow. You begin to learn the ins and outs of Indian society. Everything can be bargained for in the market and wild animals are everywhere. Creativity, loners, and independent thinking are frowned upon. If you get bullied, **IT’S YOUR FAULT FOR BEING DIFFERENT**. Anything bad that happens (poor eyesight, too short, too fat, etc.) is also **YOUR FAULT**.

&#x200B;

More Childhood – Your parents educate you on your background/culture and how it is the best in the world. In public, your family act friendly with everyone but in private they may make comments ranging from politically incorrect jokes to straight up racist statements. But it’s okay **BECAUSE YOU’RE SPECIFIC CULTURE IS THE BEST**.

&#x200B;

Teenage – The only thing that matters are grades at this point. Sports? Not for you. Music? Weak hobby. Art? That’s for transgenders. Comparisons begin with sharma ji’s beta. Pretty soon, you realize school is not about learning but regurgitating information in a short amount of time. Many people get good grades but few have any curiosity and even fewer learn good civic sense. Teachers are abusive but it’s **YOUR FAULT** because **ELDERS CAN NEVER BE WRONG**.

&#x200B;

More Teenage – You somehow get into college. Only options are medicine or engineering, otherwise you are out of the family because no one will marry you. You also realize that your parents don’t really love each other and try to emotionally blackmail you because you are the only reason they are together. Girls are to be avoided because they only want sex and are a distraction. Everyone (friends, families, distant relatives, neighbors) is in your business because **NOTHING IS PRIVATE**. You are responsible for family honor.

&#x200B;

Studenthood – You go to college. You meet many indoctrinated kids but join the crowd because who are you. You (or at least me) grew up with few female interactions and fail miserably at getting a girlfriend because you are too shy. By the time you get your act together, you are 22. At least you made some good mates.

&#x200B;

Adulthood – You become an Engineer or Doctor **BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES IT**. You probably get a job. A high paying job. It doesn’t matter how much you work, what you do, or if you enjoy it because only **MONEY MATTERS**. If you don’t get a job, it is your fault because you weren’t competitive in the rat race.

&#x200B;

Now you are expected to marry a women significantly younger than you, from a (very) similar background, is fair, very educated but also a housewife. **TROPHY WIFE**. You will be expected to live with your parents who will control your adult life just like their parents did to them. Your new goal is to get to America/Canada/UK **BECAUSE INDIANS BRING THE BEST CULTURE**. Even if you don’t make it, anyone who you know does is automatically a good friend that lives abroad.

&#x200B;

Regardless of where you are in life, you might get a son and the process repeats.",7

Indian mentality.,2,egc01b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/egc01b/indian_mentality/,0,1577486927,"This is something that I wanted to get off my chest. India got its independence in 1947 but even now indirectly we are under the rule of westerners.

Let me start with education

Our curriculum is such that , innovation and creativity is killed, we are trained and educated in such a way that we can work under the huge MNC's operated by westerners. Individuality is killed and people are corrupted by the sheep mentality. Higher education is a big joke in this country, those who pursue masters and post docs are those who couldn't land a job(most cases). We still have the slave mindset within us , we want to work for someone, doesn't matter if you like the job but we will work to get paid.The syllabus was designed by the british and we are still following it.

Moving on, we have our economy,

India and Pakistan are the cheapest countries to live in this world, not africa,not venezuela but India. What this essentially means is that if you go to any other country with the same wealth you possess in India, you will become [poorer .](https://poorer.No)  No wonder Americans use Indians for cheap labour. Even after being the cheapest country to live in , we have so many living below poverty line which speaks a lot about wealth distribution in our country. All those who come up with stats regarding GDP, please lookup GDP per person because that's what essentially matters.

We call ourselves a secular country, but ram mandir dispute constantly made headlines. Let me be honest, I dont care about who wins regarding this, but was this really a priority, can't this wait until we have progressed in other important areas?, our healthcare is in such bad condition, the state of the BPL people are pathetic but they want to construct this temple now anyways? Im not asking them to build hospitals in the place instead of the temple, that's foolishness and makes no sense, why can't they spend on healthcare and education first and afterwards think about this temple.

The defense budget is 3.18 lakh crore ,great our army is powerful and is the second largest but what the government fails to realize is that the biggest war is happening inside India. We spend so much preparing for war with other countries that we fail to fight our internal problems. Why can't the budget for healthcare and education be increased by reducing the budget for defense. Now some might argue that countries like USA too spend large o defense but the difference is that they are already developed, they don't have much problems from within whereas we are still a third world country.

All those media hype surrounding how India is a rising superpower is complete bogus, they want us to believe we are making progress so that can make good use of our pathetic situation. The real rising superpower is china, just look at their technological advancements.  

Moving on, we have sports 

The most popular sport in India is cricket. Now let me remind you that cricket was introduced by the british to us and we still play the game widely while they have moved on other sports. cricket is the number one sport only in 2 countries , India and pakistan both which were ruled by british. We are indirectly still slaves, we play the same sport they gave us even after 100 years. 

Having a population of about 1.4billion, our representation in olympics wont even equal countries which have population less than 10 million. Thats how pathetic is the condition of sports in India.

People just dont care, dont watch and don't play other sports, we simply aren't told to do so and so we refrain from playing others, only if this mentality changes will we progress in other sports, we can't just blame the government for not funding, if people aren't watching how will they fund. 

Moving on, we have women safety

Women safety is a big joke in India, Indian culture teaches us to respect women but why is the situation so pathetic.

Clearly this is because of lack of education and lack of sex education.

We wrote kamasutra, but now talking about sex is taboo. Indian schools treat sex as a foreign topic and most schools just outright skips this topic. When you say sex is taboo, it increases the curiosity in the mind of people, people crave most what they don't get/understand and like adding oil to fire we have all bollywood movies objectifying women which corrupts the weak minded and thus they give in to their sexual feelings.  

Sex education is important to understand and control one's feelings. 

I created a Fake facebook id, with a woman's picture as the profile picture and I got 879 friend requests within a day, most of them being indians, and I got 100 pm's asking me for nude pics. This level of desperation will ultimately lead to them becoming rapists and [molesters. No](https://molesters.No)   wonder women dislike Indian men.

And finally I want to end with bollywood

Most of the actors are light skinned and have features similar to europeans.Almost half of the actresses are NRI who eith er lived in england or USA.

This clearly shows that we still subconsciously are being slaves, we consider light skinned more superior, we feel they deserve more respect and this mentality should be changed if we really want progress in our society.",7

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.
